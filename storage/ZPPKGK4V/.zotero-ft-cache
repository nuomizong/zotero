Abstract
We introduce elastic textures: a set of parametric, tileable, printable, cubic patterns achieving a broad range of isotropic elastic material properties: the softest pattern is over a thousand times softer than the stiffest, and the Poisson’s ratios range from below zero to nearly 0.5. Using a combinatorial search over topologies followed by shape optimization, we explore a wide space of truss-like, symmetric 3D patterns to obtain a small family. This pattern family can be printed without internal support structure on a single-material 3D printer and can be used to fabricate objects with prescribed mechanical behavior. The family can be extended easily to create anisotropic patterns with target orthotropic properties. We demonstrate that our elastic textures are able to achieve a user-supplied varying material property distribution. We also present a material optimization algorithm to choose material properties at each point within an object to best ﬁt a target deformation under a prescribed scenario. We show that, by fabricating these spatially varying materials with elastic textures, the desired behavior is achieved.

Introduction

Rapid advances in the accessibility of additive fabrication has a signiﬁcant impact on how manufacturable geometric models are constructed. A key distinctive feature of common additive fabrication technologies is that the cost and time of production is practically uncorrelated with structural complexity: in fact, a complex structure using less material may be both cheaper and faster to produce. Complex structures, aside from potentially reducing costs, open up many new possibilities, in particular for manufacturing deformable objects. By varying a small-scale structure, one can adjust a variety of material properties, from elasticity to permeability. Importantly, these properties can be varied nearly continuously over the object, something that is not commonly done in traditional processes. As it was observed in prior work, this opens up many new possibilities for object behavior. Small-scale structures present a set of new design challenges: in all but the simplest cases, these are hard or impossible to design by hand to meet speciﬁc goals. At the same time, computational optimization of ﬁne-scale variable structure over a whole object, even of moderate size, can easily result in numerically difﬁcult topology and shape optimization problems with millions of variables. In this paper, we describe elastic volumetric textures, a library of tileable parameterized 3D small-scale structures that can be used to control the elastic material properties of an object. Applying such textures to a hex mesh with target material properties speciﬁed per element is similar to using dithering to achieve a continuous variation of brightness or color. In a sense, almost all material properties owe themselves to smallscale structures at the molecular or crystal level, and a large body of work in nanoscience aims to control material properties precisely by structure design. These works must accommodate constraints imposed by the speciﬁc properties of the elements and molecules used, the need for self-assembly, and other considerations. Our focus is on larger-scale structures, which can be manufactured using existing 3D printing technology. With feature sizes at the scale of 10µm-100µm, these are well described by conventional elasticity theory. While this type of structure was also extensively

studied, typically this was in the context of a speciﬁc problem, such as optimizing strength for a given material volume fraction. Our goal is to maximize the range of effective material properties that can be obtained using a single material by varying the structure. We consider variable-thickness truss-like structures—i.e. structures composed of connected bars—as these cover a considerable range of properties on the one hand, and on the other hand, allow us to work with a relatively small number of parameters. We present a method for building a dictionary of structures that cover a large space of material properties. These structures are tileable, which makes it possible to vary material properties across an object, and printable. We demonstrate that elastic volumetric textures allow one to control the deformation behavior of objects, either by painting material properties directly or by a two-stage shape optimization procedure, involving solving for variable continuous properties then approximating them using our texture dictionary. We validate our results by measuring samples for different choices of parameters and topologies and by demonstrating the deformation behavior of objects fabricated with spatially varying structures.

Nakasone and Silva 2010]. [Radman et al. 2013] demonstrated design of isotropic materials maximizing bulk modulus. Topology optimization offers more ﬂexibility in the choice of structure, but it requires a relatively expensive optimization for each speciﬁc problem. The ability to undergo topological transitions under continuous parameter changes is both a strength, as it allows exploration of a broader space of structures, and a weakness, as it considerably complicates design of parametric families satisfying printability and tileability constraints, which motivates our approach. Microstructure fabrication. Several groups focusing on additive fabrication have recently obtained encouraging results. In particular, materials previously thought to be unmanufacturable were produced and behave as expected. Notably, the work of Hollister and collaborators [Lin et al. 2004a; Lin et al. 2004b; Hollister 2005; Kang 2010] in the context of bone scaffold design and fusion cage design demonstrated the use of optimized microstructures. The possibility of manufacturing auxetic (negative Poisson’s ratio) materials was demonstrated in [Greaves et al. 2011], and in [Schwerdtfeger et al. 2011; B¨ ckmann et al. 2012; Andreassen et al. 2014]. u The idea of fabricating tileable structures with varying properties also appears in [Hiller and Lipson 2009] in which the authors discuss “digital materials,” as composed of a set of discrete voxels with predeﬁned shapes that can be connected. Similarly, a buildingblock based approach was also used in the context of bio-printing [Mironov et al. 2009], where the authors use spheroids of living materials with evolving and controllable composition, varying material and biological properties in time. Compliant mechanisms. The material optimization method that we present solves a similar problem to that of compliant mechanism design. [Bendsøe and Sigmund 2003] reviews several existing approaches to designing mechanisms that maximize mechanical advantage/output deﬂection or tune an output displacement to a particular path. These approaches have little control over the resulting structure’s macroscopic shape, whereas tuning deformation behavior using our microstructure approach creates a “mechanism” that still looks like the input shape. Fabrication and computer graphics. A broad variety of fabrication-related work has been done in the computer graphics community. Several techniques have been proposed to design paper craft objects [Mitani and Suzuki 2004], plush objects [Mori and Igarashi 2007], and objects made of interlocking planar slices [Cignoni et al. 2014; Schwartzburg and Pauly 2013; Hildebrand et al. 2012]. Other techniques use geometric techniques to change surface appearance by synthesizing surface microgeometry [Weyrich et al. 2009] or changing the shape to generate custom target caustics [Schwartzburg et al. 2014]. Another close work to ours, [Bickel et al. 2010], introduces an optimization process to ﬁnd the best combination of stacked layers to satisfy an input deformation, enabling fabrication of objects with complex heterogeneous materials using multi-material 3D printers. Our work can be viewed as complementary, focusing on the design of structures that can be, e.g., used as a part of deformation behavior design; our material optimization method provides an alternative to the method in that paper. In [Skouras et al. 2013], multi-material printing and discrete material optimization is used in a similar way on complex characters to achieve desired deformations with actuation. Our elastic textures can be viewed as a tool for solving this type of problem. Our structures also can be employed in systems like [Chen et al. 2013] and [Vidimˇ e et al. 2013]. c Homogenization. A central tool in our work, homogenization was used in graphics for reducing complexity of physical models in [Kharevych et al. 2009], ﬁnding the constitutive parameters of a

Microstructure design and optimization. There is a huge literature on theoretical studies of effective moduli of composites (our periodic structures are an extreme example of a composite combining a material with void). Recent monographs include [Cioranescu and Donato 1999; Milton 2002; Torquato 2002]. Much of the literature focuses on identifying microstructures with extremal effective behavior, i.e., with effective elasticity properties at the boundary of the achievable zone for a given class of composites [Allaire 2002; Cherkaev 2000; Milton 2002]. Many classes of extremal structures were described (see, e.g., [Cadman et al. 2013]), however most of these classes—e.g. sequentially laminated microstructures [Avellaneda 1987] and microstructures based on inclusions [Grabovsky and Kohn 1995; Liu et al. 2007]—are either difﬁcult or impossible to manufacture at this time. Interchangeable composites and other structures were found that maximize simultaneously, e.g., the bulk modulus and permeability [Guest and Pr´ vost 2006] or electrical e conductance [Torquato et al. 2002; Torquato et al. 2003; Torquato and Donev 2004], but these designs are of limited use for tailoring elastic behavior. The closest work to ours is [Sigmund 1995], which constructs truss microstructures with prescribed elasticity tensors. It starts with a full “ground structure” containing about 2000 candidate members, then optimizes the members’ thicknesses but not offsets to obtain a microstructure period cell whose homogenized properties (computed using a truss model) match the desired properties. Neither tileability of structures for different parameters nor printability can be guaranteed. We discuss the differences in greater detail at the end of Section 4. Further exploration of periodic structures of this type was done more recently in [Chu et al. 2010], comparing different methods for optimizing these structures. A number of microstructures were obtained using various types of topology optimization, which was originally designed for global structure optimization. In the case of microstructure design, these methods look for a periodic structure minimizing, e.g., compliance for a ﬁxed total volume fraction. The result is normally a singlescale structure, with scale controlled by the resolution of the simulation grid or other types of regularization. Important methods proposed for solving these problems include solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) and rational approximation of material properties (RAMP) [Bendsøe 1989; Bendsøe and Sigmund 2003;

low resolution discretization that best approximates the behavior of the original higher complexity material. The periodic homogenization method that we use is based on the one described in [Allaire 2002].

2. For any point of the structure, the extent covered by the structure in the X, Y, and Z directions from the point are above a printability threshold dmin . 3. Every point of the pattern is supported: for every XY slice, all connected components of the slice have at least one point connected to lower points in the structure by a segment contained in the structure. While this condition does not prevent long horizontal bars supported at single points, which can be difﬁcult to print, we have found it sufﬁcient in practice for pattern sizes up to 10mm and a dmin of 0.3mm. We also make our primary goal to generate periodic structures with isotropic homogenized properties. Such patterns have the elasticity tensor C deﬁned by two parameters, Young’s modulus E and Poisson’s ratio ν, and its inverse, compliance tensor S, has the (Voigt notation) form   1 −ν −ν 0 0 0  −ν 1 −ν 0 0 0   1  −ν −ν 1 0 0 0 S= .

While for many tasks anisotropic materials are either sufﬁcient or preferable, periodic structures with isotropic homogenized properties are easiest to use, as cell orientation is decoupled from material properties. In addition, once an isotropic starting point is obtained, it is easy to obtain a controlled anisotropic behavior. Searching the space of all possible structures in a cell, even at a ﬁnite resolution, is an impossible task. Instead, we choose a space of structures with a limited but sufﬁciently large set of parameters, that can be optimized to achieve speciﬁc material properties. Truss-like structures. We focus on truss-like structures (patterns) as shown in Figure 1, consisting of bars of different thicknesses connecting a set of nodes in the cell. Unlike real truss structures, the connections between bars are not pin joints, and ﬂexural rigidity at the nodes plays a major role. This particular space of structures is motivated by several considerations. First, the space is known to contain both very stiff and very weak patterns, providing a broad range of behaviors. Second, tileability and printability requirements yield speciﬁc geometric conditions, expressed mostly as constraints on the structure’s geometry. For example, the requirement of no enclosed voids is automatically satisﬁed if the frame structure has no self-intersections; the bound on extents can be obtained by bounding the thickness from below; and the support condition is easily formulated as a constraint on node positions. These conditions are detailed in Section 4. Symmetry considerations, as well as restrictions on the number and placement of nodes, yield a space of patterns parametrized by their set of edges connecting some subset of the 15 candidate nodes we deﬁne on a tetrahedron (their topology), thicknesses of these edges, and offsets of the nodes from their default positions. This space is still very large, and we explore it using both topology and geometry searches, described in Section 4. These rely fundamentally on the homogenization and shape optimization procedures described in Sections 5 and 6. Resulting family. The search procedure’s ﬁnal result is shown in Figure 3; the six pattern topologies themselves are illustrated in Figure 1. The complex boundaries of the (E, ν) regions arise from the

Figure 2: Overview of elastic texture generation and use. Problem. The general problem we solve can be formulated as follows: for each tensor C from a given range of elasticity tensors, and a base isotropic material with Young’s modulus E b and Poisson’s ratio ν b , ﬁnd a structure made out of the base material in a unit cubic cell, such that if the cell is inﬁnitely tiled in space, the resulting homogeneous material has elasticity tensor C. As discussed in the introduction, we aim to construct a family of patterns that are printable and tileable to enable creation of variable material properties. Printability is heavily dependent on the choice of technology. We focus on printability criteria related to stereolithography, the most accurate 3D printing method available at this time, but our approach can be easily modiﬁed to handle other technologies. As the printing process proceeds layer-by-layer, we assume that the structure is deﬁned with respect to a ﬁxed coordinate system X, Y, and Z aligned with the printer, with Z being vertical. The (idealized) printability criteria that we use are: 1. There are no enclosed voids.

multiple types of geometric constraints enforcing printability. Figure 4 shows some patterns with topology “(E1,E2)(E1,E4)(E2,E4).” The family of topologies covers a large range of Young’s moduli, with a largest-to-smallest Young’s modulus ratio of 1800, and a sizable range of Poisson’s ratios, −0.16 to 0.48. We note that the range of negative Poisson’s ratios is somewhat limited, while on the high end, we are able to achieve ratios close to the theoretical maximum. This observation is consistent with [Sigmund 1995]: while it is relatively easy to obtain more extreme negative Poisson’s ratios for patterns with cubic symmetry but with shear modulus too low for isotropy, the isotropy requirements restrict the range. Printability constraints restrict it further. Quite remarkably, four out of the six topologies can be transformed into each other by simple operations (single vertex splits, addition of cross-shaped supports connecting some nodes). The other two are also related to each other by a simple transform, but are not related to the ﬁrst sequence. We do not claim that the proposed family is in any sense optimal. It is most likely possible to extend the coverage or to cover the same domain with fewer topologies. However, the presented set is already quite useful for controlling material properties, as the examples of Section 7 show.

We fabricated eight patterns with different homogenized Young’s moduli using the B9Creator SLA printer and tested their stiffness using the BOSE ElectroForce 3200 measurement system. The machine gradually compressed our samples in the Z direction between two compression plates and measured the displacement resulting from the applied force at each step. We used 6 × 6 × 2 tilings of 5mm cells for this test. We note that our measured force/displacement slopes are roughly proportional to the homogenized Young’s moduli (Figure 5a), implying that the measurements are consistent with some (unmeasured) base Young’s modulus. The curvature seen could be explained partly by friction in the compression testing setup (Figure 5b). Another signiﬁcant source of error is the inaccuracy of our B9Creator, which tends to thicken thin geometries. We used a lower-accuracy setup to measure Poisson’s ratio but still obtained reasonable agreement with homogenization (Figure 6). We compressed the microstructures in the Z direction between two lubricated metal blocks and manually measured the expansion/contraction in the X and Y directions.

Without friction, the simulated test agrees with homogenization perfectly, but friction introduces error. We also validated the patterns’ isotropy by printing a block ﬁlled with a tiled pattern that was rotated by 45◦ around the Z axis and clipped (Figure 7). The measured effective Young’s moduli in the rotated orientations were in good agreement with the unrotated orientation: a compression test in the X, Y , and Z directions extracted effective Young’s moduli of 0.635MPa, 0.6293MPa, and 0.628MPa for the example shown. Base Material. We used estimated base material properties of E b = 200MPa and ν b = 0.35 for all results. We estimated E b using a three point bending test on rectangular bar samples, but the base Young’s modulus can also be estimated from the microstructure compression test. Using a different base Young’s material would not qualitatively change our results, apart from making the patterns uniformly softer or stiffer. The homogenized Young’s moduli depend linearly on E b , and the Poisson’s ratios are independent of E b , so scaling the base modulus simply softens/stiffens every pattern by the same factor. In particular, for the displacement-based material optimization of Section 7, fabricating the solution with a different base Young’s

which we use to identify isotropic patterns in our search. The symmetry will also dramatically reduce the space of pattern topologies to a tractable size after a few additional constraints are introduced. Note, however, that cube symmetry is not necessary for isotropy; other isotropic structures exist with, e.g., tet symmetry. Consider the group of symmetries of a cube Oh , which includes reﬂections about three symmetry planes orthogonal to the X, Y, Z axes and the six planes orthogonal to the bisector of each pair of axes. By partitioning the cube according to these symmetry planes, we obtain 48 equal tetrahedra as in Figure 8a. Oh maps a single one of these tetrahedra to any other, so it is sufﬁcient to deﬁne the nodes and edges of the pattern graph—as well as their offsets and thicknesses—on a single tetrahedron.

Figure 7: We extracted a 45◦ rotated rectangular block from a regularly tiled 10mm cell microstructure to test Young’s modulus in non-axis aligned directions. We generate the different topological conﬁgurations by changing the connectivity between 15 nodes on a tetrahedron (see Figure 8a): vertex nodes {V0 , V1 , V2 , V3 }, edge nodes {E0 , E1 , E2 , E3 , E4 , E5 }, faces nodes {F0 , F1 , F2 , F3 }, and a single internal node, T0 . Conﬁgurations are named by their graphs’ edge sets (see labels in Figure 1). Each node is constrained to stay on its respective simplex to preserve the topology, so vertex nodes are ﬁxed, edge nodes have a single offset, and so on (Figure 8b).

modulus maintains the same target deformation behavior (although the required force will change). We note that our patterns are not very sensitive to moderate changes in the base Poisson’s ratio. Changing from ν b = 0.35 to ν b = 0.35 ± 0.05 results in a median relative change in Young’s modulus of 0.683% (max: 1.88%) and a median absolute change in Poisson’s ratio of 0.00229 (max: 0.0129) over all patterns. Since most additive fabrication materials fall within this range, we expect similar results for other printers and materials.

Figure 9 shows an example topology colored by its node and edge orbits with respect to symmetry group Oh , and Figure 10 demonstrates the effects of the node offset and edge thickness parameters. The space of possible connectivities, even after accounting for symmetries, is far too large to explore completely (on the order of 1032 conﬁgurations). We enforce the following constraints to reduce the space of patterns: • Connected: the tiled pattern is a single connected component. • No coinciding edges: no edge is contained within another. E.g., if graph edge (V0 , V1 ) is chosen and E0 is the midpoint node of the corresponding tet edge, graph edge (V0 , E0 ) is forbidden since it overlaps the ﬁrst for any offset.

In this section, we describe the class of patterns that we consider and the main steps of the search method. Ground class of patterns. The topology of patterns is deﬁned by a set of edges connecting nodes in the cube cell. We generate the geometric variations by adding offsets to the node positions and by changing edge thicknesses. Motivated by the isotropy requirement, we constrain our search to patterns with cube symmetries, which are guaranteed to have the same Young’s moduli and Poisson’s ratios in every axis-aligned direction. That is, the compliance tensor has the form (1) except the last three diagonal entries 1/G may not equal 2(1 + ν)/E. This yields an easy-to-check isotropy measure: A = 2(1 + ν)G/E, (2)

• No dangling edges: every node has valence greater than 1. • Number of edges: at most 3 graph edges per tetrahedron. • Max node valence: node valences do not exceed 7. Valences are computed on the graph after periodic tiling of the cube cell. The ﬁrst two criteria reduce the space to 16221 topologies, and the remaining three to 1205 topologies. Printability. For truss-like patterns, printability is affected by two main factors: the pattern graph structure and the edge thicknesses. The ﬁrst printability criterion can be deﬁned on the nodes by considering their offset positions. We say that a node n1 has supporting node n2 , if these are connected by an edge and n1 is strictly above n2 . We say that n1 and n2 are at the same level if they have equal Z coordinates. A pattern is printable only if every connected set of nodes at one level has at least one supporting node. Printability can be tested by a simple algorithm: we ﬁrst mark as supported all nodes with a supporting node (considering periodicity). Then we propagate the front of supported nodes to neighbors at the same level. When this breadth ﬁrst search terminates, the pattern is printable if and only if all nodes are marked as supported. The procedure is illustrated in Figure 12. We also note that this constraint can be expressed algebraically as a set of inequality constraints on the offset variables, which can be enforced by an optimization solver.

Searching the space of topologies. The goal of our search is to identify a family of pattern topologies that covers as much as possible of the (E, ν) space while satisfying the printability and tileability requirements. The initial space consists of all pattern topologies satisfying the constraints on graph connectivity mentioned previously. We proceed in the following steps: 1. Coarse geometry sweep. Geometric variations are generated for each pattern topology by trying thicknesses of 0.3mm and 0.7mm and node offsets corresponding to barycentric coordinates of 0.2, 0.35, 0.5, 0.65, and 0.8 on the associated tetrahedron simplex. The resulting printable patterns are meshed, self-intersecting meshes are discarded, and the remaining patterns’ effective elasticity parameters are computed using periodic homogenization (Section 5). 2. Isotropy ﬁltering. We select a subset of the patterns closest to isotropic (we use a heuristic bound of 0.8 < A < 1.2), which we consider promising candidates as starting points for optimizing pattern parameters to precisely match a range of isotropic elasticity tensors. 3. Topological family selection. At this point, we have a rough map of the area in (E, ν) space covered by our set of patterns. We obtain a rough estimate of each topology’s coverage by taking the convex hull associated with its nearly isotropic geometric conﬁgurations. We manually pick the single family whose pattern topologies cover the largest region of (E, ν) based on these estimates. 4. Selection of a minimal covering set of topologies. For the selected family, we run a ﬁner sweep of offsets and thicknesses, again ﬁltering for printability, to compute a more precise estimate of the boundary of the (E, ν) domain that each pattern topology can cover. Among all topologies in the family, we selected 6 such that the union of their coverage areas contains most of the domain covered by the family.

Figure 12: 2D examples of the printability detection algorithm. Vertices with supporting nodes are marked (green), then a breadthﬁrst search extends the supported vertex front to horizontal neighbors. The remaining unmarked nodes are unsupported (red). Two cases are shown: unprintable (top) and printable (bottom). Tileability. The tileability requirement means that all pattern topologies should belong to the same family, meaning topologies with the same set of nodes and edges appearing on the faces of the cube cell (Figure 11).

5. Lookup map construction. Finally, using the shape optimization machinery of Section 6 and the initial nearly-isotropic points for each of the 6 topologies chosen, we optimize each patterns’ parameters to reach a grid of isotropic elasticity tensors evenly spaced in (log(E), ν). Our procedure is similar to [Sigmund 1995], but with several key differences. First, [Sigmund 1995] uses a simpliﬁed truss model, whereas our method directly homogenizes and optimizes the printable geometry. Second, by using a full topology (including all possible edges between nodes in a ground structure) and permitting zero edge thickness in optimization, the work avoids the topol-

While a mixed-integer formulation like [Mela and Koski 2013] could allow enforcement of dmin by introducing separate binary variables to disable members, this would involve a difﬁcult mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem in our tensor-ﬁtting setting. Finally, by introducing offset variables, our novel shape optimization approach enables much ﬁner control of the elasticity tensors as the design is not limited to the discrete node positions of a ground structure.

Expressions for the homogenized tensor. The standard derivation of the homogenized elasticity tensor based on a two-scale asymptotic expansion is provided in the additional material. Here we give an intuitive motivation for the periodic homogenization equations. u has a high frequency periodic component that is averaged out to obtain u as period → 0. So u(x) can be thought of as the average displacement over the inﬁnitesimal base cell Y at point x. Likewise, ε(u) is the average strain in the cell. For the object to be in equilibrium, (4) should represent an average force balance over the cell, meaning C H : ε(u) should be the average stress tensor. That gives the following intuitive interpretation of C H : it maps the average strain applied at a point to the average stress resulting within the microstructure geometry. Thus, applying C H to ε(u) is equivalent to simulating the microstructure’s deformation under that average strain and averaging its stress. We formulate this simulation inside a single base cell Y by assuming that the displacement consists of a linear term (with constant strain ε(u)) plus a Y -periodic “microscopic ﬂuctuation” term, w (with zero average strain by periodicity). This assumption of periodicity is reasonable because, by the translational symmetry of an inﬁnite tiling, every cell deforms identically. Now we simply solve for ﬂuctuation w putting the microstructure in equilibrium: − · (C(y) : [ε(w(y)) + ε(u)]) = 0 in Y,

From Patterns to Material Properties

Our goal is to ﬁnd the homogenized elasticity tensor C H , describing the effective properties of the microstructure when it is fabricated at a small enough scale and periodically repeated to ﬁll the space. This elasticity tensor is almost never the spatial average of elasticity tensors (for example, if a cell is almost completely ﬁlled with material but is disconnected from other cells, it has zero Young’s modulus). We ﬁrst deﬁne more precisely what a homogenized elasticity tensor is and then explain how to compute it. Deﬁning the homogenized tensor. Consider heterogeneous object Ω ﬁlled with a periodic microstructure, as shown schematically in Figure 13. Parameter determines the size of cell Y relative to the object Ω and permits asymptotic analysis as → 0.

where y is the microscopic variable (the coordinate in Y ). Then the 1 average stress is C H : ε(u) = |Y | Y C : [ε(w) + ε(u)] dy. We can extract the components of C H by applying it to the 6 canonical symmetric rank 2 basis tensors, ekl := 1 (ek ⊗ el + el ⊗ ek ). 2 Each application amounts to solving the cell problem: − [C

complemented by appropriate boundary conditions. Here, C is the periodically varying elasticity tensor, and C : ε denotes its double contraction with strain (Cijkl εkl ) to compute stress. Considering a sequence of problems indexed by and letting u denote the limit of u as → 0, the homogenized elasticity tensor C H is deﬁned as the tensor that satisﬁes − · [C H : ε(u)] = f in Ω, (4)

The last constraint in (5) eliminates the rigid translation degrees of freedom that still remain after enforcing Y -periodicity. The homogenized elasticity tensor components are ﬁnally just the average over Y of the stress components corresponding to ekl :

It is worth noting that C H does not depend at all on the macroscopic details (shape Ω, force term f , or boundary conditions).

FEM implementation. The cell problems (5) are solved numerically by a quadratic tetrahedral FEM discretization of ω. The piecewise linear integrand in (7) is integrated with exact quadrature. Given the wire network of the microstructure, deﬁning its topology (Section 4), a volume mesh is generated following the STRUT algorithm given in [Hart 2008]: (i) A polygon is created around both ends of each segment. (ii) For each vertex, the convex hull of the nearby polygons and the vertex is constructed and the polygons themselves are removed from the hull. (iii) For each edge, the convex hull of its two polygons is constructed, and again the two polygons are removed from the hull. A tetrahedral volume mesh is ﬁnally created from the resulting closed surface. The linear elasticity solver must support periodic boundary conditions, which requires the tetrahedral mesh to have an identical tessellation on the opposite periodic cell faces. Convergence rate. Remarkably, we have observed that the homogenized coefﬁcients remain accurate when the microstructure varies across cells (with few or no repetitions). In our experiments, the deformation behavior of even very coarse tilings closely matches the homogenized behavior (Figure 14), and we expect similar agreement in general for smoothly varying loads.

which we optimize by varying the microstructure shape, ω. In our case, the microstructure boundary ∂ω is determined by a small number of parameters p, consisting of wire mesh node offsets and thicknesses. While the number of parameters is small, we still expect multiple solutions for minimizing J(ω) with respect to these parameters. A simple regularization term (staying close to the initial point of optimization) picks a unique solution. We note that instead some quantity of importance (e.g., weight) can be optimized as it is typically done (cf., [Sigmund 1995]), adding another nonlinear term to the functional. The derivative of the boundary ∂ω with respect to a parameter pα is a vector ﬁeld vpα (y) deﬁned at points y of ∂ω, with vpα (y) being the velocity of y if parameter pα changes at unit speed. Using parameters p as variables, the minimization problem can be written as argmin J(p) where J(p) =

The admissibility of parameters is determined by geometric intersection constraints and printability constraints. The derivative of the objective function with respect to pα can be obtained from vpα using the chain rule:

An essential step for creating a map of elastic textures is optimizing a pattern with ﬁxed topology to match particular elasticity parameters. This is achieved using shape optimization with respect to the pattern parameters. The optimization problem. Our goal is to minimize a functional, J(ω), measuring the difference between the homogenized elastic properties of the pattern and a target elasticity tensor C ∗ . We choose an objective that is suitable for designing material distributions with large deformations under moderate forces. The distance of compliance tensors, S H − S ∗ , as opposed to elasticity tensors, is the better choice, since the strain for a constant stress is directly proportional to S H , not C H . In fact, minimizing the Frobenius norm of S H − S ∗ can be interpreted as a multi-objective least squares optimization to ﬁt the displacements of two cubes—one ﬁlled with C H and the other with C ∗ —under a set of axis-aligned stretching and shearing loads. We choose this Frobenius norm as our functional: J(ω) = 1 H S (ω) − S ∗ 2

To evaluate the gradient for a given shape we need (a) to mesh the shape (we use the TetGen package [Si 2010]); (b) solve 6 periodic elasticity problems to obtain wij , as for homogenization. The cost of a single gradient evaluation (roughly 4.75s on a single core of an Intel Xeon E-2690 v2) is dominated by the cost of periodic meshing and the elasticity solves, which take roughly equal time. We use the Ceres solver [Agarwal et al. ]’s Levenberg-Marquardt implementation to minimize the objective; the convergence of the solver is quite fast (Figure 16). Typical effects of optimization are shown in Figure 17.

a corresponding pattern (topology id, thicknesses, and offsets) from the lookup table. The microstructures in adjacent cells are stitched together by averaging the offsets of each pair of shared face nodes so that they coincide. This might raise the lower node of the pair above some node it supports, ns , violating printability, but printability can be restored by lowering the pair to ns ’s height. After this step, the resulting connected wire mesh is inﬂated with retrieved bar thicknesses, using the process described at the end of Section 5. This results in a ﬁne mesh that can be printed. Material painting. The simplest approach to specifying the material properties (E, ν) is to paint them on a voxel grid. We have created an editor enabling us to paint these layer by layer. The results of fabricating several structures of this type are shown in Figure 18. Material optimization. Manually deﬁning material properties to achieve desired behavior may be difﬁcult, and a more systematic approach is to solve for them. For example, consider the following problem: for given applied displacement conditions on some part of the object’s boundary, we would like to get some target deformation—e.g., if a bar is compressed along the Z axis, it twists in the X-Y plane—by varying material properties. In other words, we want to ﬁnd a spatially varying tensor Cp (x), parametrized by a vector of per-cell isotropic parameters p, such that the following system has a solution: − · (Cp : ε(u)) = 0 u = uin u = utrg σ(u)ˆ = 0 n in Ω on Γin on Γtrg on Γtrg

Applications

While our primary focus is on the design of our pattern family and the exploration of its coverage, we demonstrate the application of our elastic textures in two settings: painted material properties and speciﬁed deformation behavior. All printing was done using a B9Creator printer at 50 micron resolution with Cherry resin. Overall workﬂow. The result of the preceding sections is a lookup map that, for a given (E, ν), produces an isotropic microstructure with nearby parameters. We assume that we are given a coarse volume mesh ﬁlled with identical cube cells. First, we assign a pair (Ei , νi ) to each cell i, either directly or via material optimization as described below. For each cell, we retrieve

where uin are the applied displacements on compressed area Γin , and utrg are the target displacements of the surface Γtrg on which no forces are applied, as indicated by the last equation. In our implementation, these target/applied conditions can be speciﬁed on a per-component basis to set up, e.g., the twisting bar example. In general, such problems are solved using PDE constrained optimization, requiring solving an adjoint problem at each iteration. However, we found that the following local-global iteration, inspired by related “as-rigid-as-possible” (ARAP) optimization techniques in geometry, works remarkably well. For a ﬁxed Cp (x), we call uD the solution of the “Dirichlet problem,” with the condition of zero tractions on Γtrg removed. uN is the solution of the “NeuACM Transactions on Graphics, Vol. 34, No. 4, Article 135, Publication Date: August 2015

All our simulations and constructions work in the linear regime, not taking into account, e.g., the potential for pattern buckling or other damage. Fortunately, isotropy is correlated with sufﬁciently high shear modulus, which makes the patterns less prone to buckling. Nevertheless, including this and other nonlinear effects in pattern design is important. For practical use, it is difﬁcult to restrict the tessellations of objects to equal sized cubes (though one can construct cut cells covered with relatively soft skin). A desirable solution would be to allow patterns to distort to ﬁll arbitrary reasonably well-shaped hex cells.

This energy can be minimized per-cell for a truly local-global method; however, in practice we ﬁnd it desirable to regularize p with a Laplacian term, which requires that the “local” step be replaced by a global, but still quadratic optimization. The convergence of this method is shown in Figure 19.

Conclusions

We have presented a family of tileable and printable patterns that can be used to approximate varying isotropic material properties. The family has proved useful on a number of simple shape optimization examples: remarkably, all examples in Section 7 worked as predicted by simulation without requiring much tuning. Limitations. There are several limitations of our pattern family. First, some parts of the (E, ν) space are poorly covered. While it
