Abstract
Experiences in modelling and development of methods for the nonlinear finite element analysis of the loading behaviour of aircraft fuselage panels are presented. Simulations were performed using panels with especially developed aircraft like boundary conditions. Detection of maximum load is influenced by the way the load is applied in connection with appropriate imperfections. The problem of finding the correct load path in the vicinity of bifurcation points is discussed. Presented solutions include standard perturbation by single force imperfections, empirically proved displacement difference method and the eigenvalue tracking method. A material model for mesomarco coupling of nonlinear panel and barrel analysis is presented which introduces nonlinear effects into a coarse meshed FE barrel model for preliminary design purposes. 1 Introduction Starting in 2001 CADFEM developed an ANSYS-based tool for the determination of buckling onset and the ultimate load of stiffened aircraft fuselage panels (Ref. 2, 3, 4, 5). The tool provides a GUI driven preprocessor for the data input and automatically generates the geometry and the finite element model for nonlinear analysis. The finite element results were validated by comparisons with shear-compression and frame bending tests performed at Airbus, Hamburg, see Fig. 1.

Fig. 1 Assessment of test rig simulation results 2 Finite Element Modelling Subject of the following considerations are standard fuselage panels, nevertheless recent designs and future developments are also in the focus of investigations. The structures investigated consist of standard single sheet to multi-sheet metal, Glare and CFRP. Connections were made by riveting, welding and gluing. FE-Models for test rig simulations include detailed modelling of reinforcements, additional stiffeners, cutouts and load introduction. Shear compression as well as frame bending test rig modelling is implemented. Special aircraft like boundary conditions (ALBC) have been developed to simulate the loading behaviour of arbitrary rectangular panels under shear compression/tension and inner pressure loading. The FE-model mainly consists of 4-node shell elements of the Reissner-Mindlin type with an assumed strain formulation against shear locking and incompatible modes to improve the in-plane behaviour. Rivets are represented by beam elements, thin volume elements are utilized to model glue layers. Doublers and pocketing were represented by layered shells with offset to the reference plane. Contact elements are used wherever necessary. Delamination and debonding modelling is available. See Fig. 2.

It shows the well-known convergence problems in the vicinity of the maximum load. Displacement controlled loading leads to a higher numerical stability than force controlled loading. In general the unstable force-displacement path can be reached. Displacement controlled loading has to refer to a given shear/compression(tension) force ratio. Thus a special coupling of the boundaries using constraint equations was developed, it also refers to the moment free application of lateral forces, results see Fig. 4.

4.2 Imperfections In the ideal system with ALBC imperfections are necessary to initiate the branching to the relevant load path. Otherwise too high ultimate loads can be determined lying on unstable paths, see Fig. 5.

Fig. 5 Branching to different load paths Scaled modes from linear buckling analysis often assumed to be appropriate imperfections. Due to the assumption of linear behaviour until buckling, however, they can only be used to predict the first buckling. Furthermore, if buckling analysis delivers multiple eigenvalues a linear combination of the related buckling modes must be found even for the buckling onset while the weighting factors are unknown. The bifurcation to the post-critical branch can show different patterns. Therefore, other types of imperfections are preferred in these investigations. Results are presented for the following methods. 4.2.1 Force-type Imperfection The number of half-waves of the buckling pattern can be estimated from the frame an stringer pitches. Forces in the estimated middle can initiate buckling. In order not to overpredict the buckling pattern the number of forces is restricted to two concentrated close to one edge of the skin field. An excentricity for the loading points in axial and in circumferential direction is chosen to initiate the typical buckling modes for compression as well as for shear loading. In practice this imperfection lead to a regular buckling pattern. 4.2.2 Imperfection from Results If the ultimate load is not reached in the first attempt, which can be seen in the load-displacement (or substep) curve, the initial forces are removed and a scaled geometric imperfection is applied which results out of the subtraction of displacements of the subsequent last converged substeps. It shows how the system will deform further. The analysis is restarted from zero load level. In nearly all cases a limit point was reached in this second attempt. 4.2.3 Eigenvalue Analysis Depending on the formulation of the eigenvalue problem an eigenvalue analysis of the tangential stiffness matrix leads to an eigenvalue of 0 or 1 at a limit or a bifurcation point. The related mode then indicates the tendency of the bifurcation. The mode is similar closely under the bifurcation load level and can be used as an imperfection. However, if used as a stress-free initial pre-deformation the analysis must be rerun from the beginning including the danger that earlier buckling is missed. Better is the perturbation of the initial displacement vector in the Newton-Raphson iteration by the scaled buckling mode (Eigenvalue Tracking Method), see Fig. 6.

5 Determining System Reserves by Introducing Non-Linear Behaviour into a Coarse Barrel Model In the dimensioning and evaluation process of an aircraft fuselage nominal stresses were obtained from a linear elastic fuselage or section FE model (barrel) discretized with shell and beam elements using one shell element for the skin between adjacent stringers and frames. This model does not account for nonlinearities. However, the stresses are compared with allowable obtained from tests or nonlinear finite element simulations. The coarse linear FE barrel does not account for changes of the force fluxes due to reaching the local ultimate load or local buckling. A method is presented which transfers the local nonlinear behavior drived from the FE analysis of panels with fine meshes to the coarse meshed global barrel model. The nonlinear local force displacement behavior is introduced to the global model by an elasto-plastic material law. It is shown how the stress-strain curves for shear and compression loading (of different shape) interact in the yield condition, how the flow rule is chosen and how the hardening rule accounts for different ratios of shear and compression. An example demonstrates that the assumptions work well and that the global system reaches a higher load level compared with the standard method. Possible extensions and limits of the method are outlined.
