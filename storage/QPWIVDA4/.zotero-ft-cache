PREFACE

The finite element method is a numerical method that can be used for the accurate solution of complex engineering problems. The method was first developed in 1956 for the analysis of aircraft structural problems. Thereafter, within a decade, the potentialities of the method for the solution of different types of applied science and engineering problems were recognized. Over the years, the finite element technique has been so well established that today it is considered to be one of the best methods for solving a wide variety of practical problems efficiently. In fact, the method has become one of the active research areas for applied mathematicians. One of the main reasons for the popularity of the method in different fields of engineering is that once a general computer program is written, it can be used for the solution of any problem simply by changing the input data. The objective of this book is to introduce the various aspects of finite element method as applied to engineering problems in a systematic manner. It is attempted to give details of development of each of the techniques and ideas from basic principles. New concepts are illustrated with simple examples wherever possible. Several Fortran computer programs are given with example applications to serve the following purposes: - to enable the student to understand the computer implementation of the theory developed; - to solve specific problems; - to indicate procedure for the development of computer programs for solving any other problem in the same area. The source codes of all the Fortran computer programs can be found at the Web site for the book, www.books.elsevier.com. Note that the computer programs are intended for use by students in solving simple problems. Although the programs have been tested, no warranty of any kind is implied as to their accuracy. After studying the material presented in the book, a reader will not only be able to understand the current literature of the finite element method but also be in a position to develop short computer programs for the solution of engineering problems. In addition, the reader will be in a position to use the commercial software, such as ABAQUS, NASTRAN, and ANSYS, more intelligently. The book is divided into 22 chapters and an appendix. Chapter 1 gives an introduction and overview of the finite element method. The basic approach and the generality of the method are illustrated through simple examples. Chapters 2 through 7 describe the basic finite element procedure and the solution of the resulting equations. The finite element discretization and modeling, including considerations in selecting the number and types of elements, is discussed in Chapter 2. The interpolation models in terms of Cartesian and natural coordinate systems are given in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 describes the higher order and isoparametric elements. The use of Lagrange and Hermite polynomials is also discussed in this chapter. The derivation of element characteristic matrices and vectors using direct, variational, and weighted residual approaches is given in Chapter 5.

PREFACE

The assembly of element characteristic matrices and vectors and the derivation of system equations, including the various methods of incorporating the boundary conditions, are indicated in Chapter 6. The solutions of finite element equations arising in equilibrium, eigenvalue, and propagation (transient or unsteady) problems, along with their computer implementation, are briefly outlined in Chapter 7. The application of the finite element method to solid and structural mechanics problems is considered in Chapters 8 through 12. The basic equations of solid mechanics--namely, the internal and external equilibrium equations, stress-strain relations, strain-displacement relations and compatibility conditions--are summarized in Chapter 8. The analysis of trusses, beams, and frames is the topic of Chapter 9. The development of inplane and bending plate elements is discussed in Chapter 10. The analysis of axisymmetric and three-dimensional solid bodies is considered in Chapter 11. The dynamic analysis, including the free and forced vibration, of solid and structural mechanics problems is outlined in Chapter 12. Chapters 13 through 16 are devoted to heat transfer applications. The basic equations of conduction, convection, and radiation heat transfer are summarized and the finite element equations are formulated in Chapter 13. The solutions of one-. two-, and threedimensional heat transfer problems are discussed in Chapters 14-16. respectively. Both the steady state and transient problems are considered. The application of the finite element method to fluid mechanics problems is discussed in Chapters 17-19. Chapter 17 gives a brief outline of the basic equations of fluid mechanics. The analysis of inviscid incompressible flows is considered in Chapter 18. The solution of incompressible viscous flows as well as non-Newtonian fluid flows is considered in Chapter 19. Chapters 20-22 present additional applications of the finite element method. In particular, Chapters 20-22 discuss the solution of quasi-harmonic (Poisson), Helmholtz, and Reynolds equations, respectively. Finally, Green-Gauss theorem, which deals with integration by parts in two and three dimensions, is given in Appendix A. This book is based on the author's experience in teaching the course to engineering students during the past several years. A basic knowledge of matrix theory is required in understanding the various topics presented in the book. More than enough material is included for a first course at the senior or graduate level. Different parts of the book can be covered depending on the background of students and also on the emphasis to be given on specific areas, such as solid mechanics, heat transfer, and fluid mechanics. The student can be assigned a term project in which he/she is required to either modify some of the established elements or develop new finite elements, and use them for the solution of a problem of his/her choice. The material of the book is also useful for self study by practicing engineers who would like to learn the method and/or use the computer programs given for solving practical problems. I express my appreciation to the students who took my courses on the finite element method and helped me improve the presentation of the material. Finally, I thank my wife Kamala for her tolerance and understanding while preparing the manuscript. Miami May 2004

O V E R V I E W OF FINITE E L E M E N T METHOD

1.1 BASIC CONCEPT The basic idea in the finite element m e t h o d is to find the solution of a complicated problem by replacing it by a simpler one. Since the actual problem is replaced by a simpler one in finding the solution, we will be able to find only an approximate solution rather t h a n the exact solution. The existing m a t h e m a t i c a l tools will not be sufficient to find the exact solution (and sometimes, even an approximate solution) of most of the practical problems. Thus, in the absence of any other convenient m e t h o d to find even the approximate solution of a given problem, we have to prefer the finite element method. Moreover, in the finite element method, it will often be possible to improve or refine the approximate solution by spending more computational effort.
In the finite element method, the solution region is considered as built up of many small, interconnected subregions called finite elements. As an example of how a finite element model might be used to represent a complex geometrical shape, consider the milling machine structure shown in Figure 1.1(a). Since it is very difficult to find the exact response (like stresses and displacements) of the machine under any specified cutting (loading) condition, this structure is approximated as composed of several pieces as shown in Figure 1.1(b) in the finite element method. In each piece or element, a convenient approximate solution is assumed and the conditions of overall equilibrium of the structure are derived. The satisfaction of these conditions will yield an approximate solution for the displacements and stresses. Figure 1.2 shows the finite element idealization of a fighter aircraft.

1.2 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND Although the name of the finite element m e t h o d was given recently, the concept dates back for several centuries. For example, ancient m a t h e m a t i c i a n s found the circumference of a circle by approximating it by the perimeter of a polygon as shown in Figure 1.3.
In terms of the present-day notation, each side of the polygon can be called a "finite element." By considering the approximating polygon inscribed or circumscribed, one can obtain a lower bound S (z) or an upper bound S (~) for the true circumference S. Furthermore, as the number of sides of the polygon is increased, the approximate values

converge to the true value. These characteristics, as will be seen later, will hold true in any general finite element application. In recent times, an approach similar to the finite element method, involving the use of piecewise continuous functions defined over triangular regions, was first suggested by Courant [1.1] in 1943 in the literature of applied mathematics. The basic ideas of the finite element method as known today were presented in the papers of Turner, Clough, Martin, and Topp [1.2] and Argyris and Kelsey [1.3]. The name finite element was coined by Clough [1.4]. Reference [1.2] presents the application of simple finite elements (pin-jointed bar and triangular plate with inplane loads) for the analysis of aircraft structure and is considered as one of the key contributions in the development of the finite element method. The digital computer provided a rapid means of performing the many calculations involved in the finite element analysis and made the method practically viable. Along with the development of high-speed digital computers, the application of the finite element method also progressed at a very impressive rate. The book by Przemieniecki [1.33] presents the finite element method as applied to the solution of stress analysis problems. Zienkiewicz and Cheung [1.5] presented the broad interpretation of the method and its applicability to any general field problem. With this broad interpretation of the finite element method, it has been found that the finite element equations can also be derived by using a weighted residual method such as Galerkin method or the least squares approach. This led to widespread interest among applied mathematicians in applying the finite element method for the solution of linear and nonlinear differential equations. Over the years, several papers, conference proceedings, and books have been published on this method. A brief history of the beginning of the finite element method was presented by Gupta and Meek [1.6]. Books that deal with the basic theory, mathematical foundations, mechanical design, structural, fluid flow, heat transfer, electromagnetics and manufacturing applications, and computer programming aspects are given at the end of the chapter [1.10-1.32]. With all the progress, today the finite element method is considered one of the well-established and convenient analysis tools by engineers and applied scientists.

1.3 GENERAL APPLICABILITY OF THE METHOD Although the m e t h o d has been extensively used in the field of structural mechanics, it has been successfully applied to solve several other types of engineering problems, such as heat conduction, fluid dynamics, seepage flow, and electric and magnetic fields. These applications p r o m p t e d mathematicians to use this technique for the solution of complicated b o u n d a r y value and other problems. In fact, it has been established t h a t the method can be used for the numerical solution of ordinary and partial differential equations. The general applicability of the finite element m e t h o d can be seen by observing the strong similarities t h a t exist between various types of engineering problems. For illustration, let us consider the following phenomena.

1.3.1 One-Dimensional Heat Transfer Consider the thermal equilibrium of an element of a heated one-dimensional body as shown in Figure 1.5(a). The rate at which heat enters the left face can be written as [1.7]
qx = - k A ~OT Ox

(1.1)

where k is the thermal conductivity of the material, A is the area of cross section through which heat flows (measured perpendicular to the direction of heat flow), and O T / O x is the rate of change of t e m p e r a t u r e T with respect to the axial direction. The rate at which heat leaves the right face can be expressed as (by retaining only two terms in the Taylor's series expansion)

A comparison of Eqs. (1.7), (1.12), and (1.14) indicates t h a t a solution procedure applicable to any one of the problems can be used to solve the others also. We shall see how the finite element m e t h o d can be used to solve Eqs. (1.7), (1.12), and (1.14) with a p p r o p r i a t e b o u n d a r y conditions in Section 1.5 and also in subsequent chapters.

OVERVIEW OF FINITE ELEMENT METHOD

1.4 ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF THE FINITE ELEMENT M E T H O D As stated earlier, the finite element m e t h o d was developed originally for the analysis of aircraft structures. However, the general nature of its theory makes it applicable to a wide variety of b o u n d a r y value problems in engineering. A b o u n d a r y value problem is one in which a solution is sought in the domain (or region) of a body subject to the satisfaction of prescribed b o u n d a r y (edge) conditions on the dependent variables or their derivatives. Table 1.1 gives specific applications of the finite element m e t h o d in the three major categories of b o u n d a r y value problems, namely, (i) equilibrium or steady-state or time-independent problems, (ii) eigenvalue problems, and (iii) propagation or transient problems.
In an equilibrium problem, we need to find the steady-state displacement or stress distribution if it is a solid mechanics problem, t e m p e r a t u r e or heat flux distribution if it is a heat transfer problem, and pressure or velocity distribution if it is a fluid mechanics problem. In eigenvalue problems also. time will not appear explicitly. They may be considered as extensions of equilibrium problems in which critical values of certain parameters are to be determined in addition to the corresponding steady-state configurations. In these problems, we need to find the natural frequencies or buckling loads and mode shapes if it is a solid mechanics or structures problem, stability of laminar flows if it is a fluid mechanics problem, and resonance characteristics if it is an electrical circuit problem. The propagation or transient problems are time-dependent problems. This type of problem arises, for example, whenever we are interested in finding the response of a body under time-varying force in the area of solid mechanics and under sudden heating or cooling in the field of heat transfer.

1.5 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE FINITE ELEMENT M E T H O D In the finite element method, the actual continuum or body of matter, such as a solid, liquid, or gas, is represented as an assemblage of subdivisions called finite elements. These elements are considered to be interconnected at specified joints called nodes or nodal points. The nodes usually lie on the element boundaries where adjacent elements are considered to be connected. Since the actual variation of the field variable (e.g., displacement, stress, temperature, pressure, or velocity) inside the continuum is not known, we assume t h a t the variation of the field variable inside a finite element can be approximated by a simple function. These approximating functions (also called interpolation models) are defined in terms of the values of the field variables at the nodes. W h e n field equations (like equilibrium equations) for the whole continuum are written, the new unknowns will be the nodal values of the field variable. By solving the field equations, which are generally in the form of matrix equations, the nodal values of the field variable will be known. Once these are known, the approximating functions define the field variable t h r o u g h o u t the assemblage of elements.
The solution of a general continuum problem by the finite element method always follows an orderly step-by-step process. W i t h reference to static structural problems, the step-by-step procedure can be stated as follows:

Step (i):

Discretization of the structure

The first step in the finite element method is to divide the structure or solution region into subdivisions or elements. Hence, the structure is to be modeled with suitable finite elements. The number, type, size, and arrangement of the elements are to be decided.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD

Step (ii):

Selection of a proper interpolation or displacement model

Since the displacement solution of a complex structure under any specified load conditions cannot be predicted exactly, we assume some suitable solution within an element to approximate the unknown solution. The assumed solution must be simple from a computational standpoint, but it should satisfy certain convergence requirements. In general, the solution or the interpolation model is taken in the form of a polynomial.

Step (iii):

Derivation of element stiffness matrices and load vectors

From the assumed displacement model, the stiffness matrix [K (~)] and the load vector /3(r of element e are to be derived by using either equilibrium conditions or a suitable variational principle.

Step

(iv):

Assemblage of element equations to obtain the overall equilibrium equations

Since the structure is composed of several finite elements, the individual element stiffness matrices and load vectors are to be assembled in a suitable manner and the overall equilibrium equations have to be formulated as [K]~~ (1.15)

where [K] is the assembled stiffness matrix, ~ is the vector of nodal displacements, and P is the vector of nodal forces for the complete structure.

Step

(v):

Solution for the unknown nodal displacements

The overall equilibrium equations have to be modified to account for the b o u n d a r y conditions of the problem. After the incorporation of the b o u n d a r y conditions, the equilibrium equations can be expressed as [K](P - - / 3 (1.16)

For linear problems, the vector 0 can be solved very easily. However, for nonlinear problems, the solution has to be obtained in a sequence of steps, with each step involving the modification of the stiffness matrix [K] a n d / o r the load vector P.

Step

(vi):

C o m p u t a t i o n of element strains and stresses

From the known nodal displacements (I), if required, the element strains and stresses can be computed by using the necessary equations of solid or structural mechanics. The terminology used in the previous six steps has to be modified if we want to extend the concept to other fields. For example, we have to use the t e r m continuum or domain in place of structure, field variable in place of displacement, characteristic matrix in place of stiffness matrix, and element resultants in place of element strains. The application of the six steps of the finite element analysis is illustrated with the help of the following examples. E x a m p l e 1.2 (Stress analysis of a stepped bar) Find the stresses induced in the axially loaded stepped bar shown in Figure 1.6(a). The bar has cross-sectional areas of A (1) and A (2) over the lengths/(1) and l(2), respectively. Assume the following data: A (1) = 2 cm 2 A (2) = 1 cm2;/(1) = 1(2) = 10 cm; E (1) - E (2) - E - 2 • 10 7 N / c m 2" P3 - 1 N.

Since there are only c o n c e n t r a t e d loads acting at the nodes of the bar (and no d i s t r i b u t e d load acts on the bar), the work done by external forces can be expressed as

where Pi denotes the force applied in the direction of the displacement ~i (i - 1, 2, 3). In this example, P1 - reaction at fixed node. P2 - 0. and P3 - 1.0. If external d i s t r i b u t e d loads act on the elements, the corresponding element load vectors, /3(a~), will be g e n e r a t e d for each element and the individual load vectors will be assembled to generate the global load vector of the svstem due to d i s t r i b u t e d load,/3d. This load vector is to be added to the global load vector due to c o n c e n t r a t e d loads./5c, to generate the total global nodal load vector of the system. ~ - Pd + Pc. In the present example, there are no distributed loads on the element: external load acts only at one node and hence the global load vector t5 is taken to be same as the vector of c o n c e n t r a t e d loads acting at the nodes of the system.

Since the displacements of the left and right nodes of the first element are 01 and 02, the rows and columns of the stiffness matrix corresponding to these unknowns are identified as indicated in Eq. (E13). Similarly, the rows and columns of the stiffness matrix of the second element corresponding to its nodal unknowns O2 and 03 are also identified as indicated in Eq. (El4). The overall stiffness matrix of the bar can be obtained by assembling the two element stiffness matrices. Since there are three nodal displacement unknowns (~1, 02, and 03), the global stiffness matrix, [K], will be of order three. To obtain [h'], the elements of [K (1)] and [K (2)] corresponding to the unknowns 01, 02, and 03 are added as shown below: q)l [K]=106 -4 0 02 4+2 -2 O3 02 <1)3

1.6.1 Derivation of the Equation of Motion for the Vibration of a Beam [1.9] By considering the dynamic equilibrium of an element of the beam shown in Figure 1.9, we have
F - (F + d F ) - p d x = 0 (vertical force equilibrium) or dF dx = P

(1.17)

where F and M denote the shear force and bending moment at a distance x, d F and d M indicate their increments over an elemental distance dx, p represents the external force acting on the beam per unit length, and

M - (M + d M ) + F d x - p d x - ~

- 0 (moment equilibrium about point A)

which can be written, after neglecting the term involving (dx) 2, as dM =F dx Combining Eqs. (1.17) and (1.18)we obtain d2M =p(x) dx 2 The curvature of the deflected center line of the beam, w ( x ) , is given by

From strength of materials, we know the relation 1 ~I (1.22)

where R is the radius of curvature, I is the moment of inertia of the cross section of the beam, and E is the Young's modulus of material. By combining Eqs. (1.19), (1.21), and (1.22), we have

where C1-C4 are constants to be determined from the boundary conditions. In view of Eq. (1.28), the boundary conditions for a fixed-fixed beam can be written as

If we substitute Eq. (1.31) into Eqs. (1.32), we get four linear homogeneous equations in the unknowns C1-C4. For a nontrivial solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero. This gives the condition [1.9]

Equation (1.33) is called the frequency equation and there will be infinite number of solutions to it. Let us call the n t h solution of Eq. (1.aa) as & L. If we use this solution in Eqs. (1.30) and (1.31) we obtain the natural frequencies as

1.6.3 Approximate Analytical Solution (Rayleigh's Method)

(1.29), and substitute it in Eq. (1.42). Let us take It'(x) -2rrx) 1 - cos ~ (1.43)

This satisfies the boundary conditions stated in Eq. (1.32) and not the equation of motion, Eq. (1.29). By substituting Eq. (1.43) into Eq. (1.42), we obtain the approximate value of

1.6.4 Approximate Analytical Solution (Rayleigh-Ritz Method)
If we want many natural frequencies, we have to substitute a solution, made up of a series of admissible functions that satisfy the forced boundary conditions, in Eq. (1.42). For example, if we want n frequencies, we take W(z) = where

C1, C2,..., Cn are constants and fl, f 2 , . . . , f~ are admissible functions. If we substitute Eq. (1.45) into Eq. (1.42), we obtain 5:2 as a function of C~, C2,..., C,~.

Since the actual frequency w will be smaller than 5: [1.9], we want to choose C1, C 2 , . . . , C~ such that they make 5: a minimum. For this, we set 0(9 = O(&2) . . . . . 0(~ = 0 (1.46)

1.6.5 Approximate Analytical Solution (Galerkin Method)
To find the approximate solution of Eq. (1.29) with the b o u n d a r y conditions stated in Eq. (1.32), using the Galerkin method, we assume the solution to be of the form I I'(x) - C t f , ( x ) -4- C2f2(.r) + " " + Cnfn(x) (1.52)

where C1, C2 . . . . . Cn are constants and fl. f2 . . . . . f , are functions t h a t satisfy all the specified b o u n d a r y conditions. Since the solution assumed. Eq. (1.52), is not an exact one, it will not satisfy Eq. (1.29). and we will obtain, upon substitution into the left-hand side of the equation, a quantity different from zero (known as the residual. R). The values of the constants C1, C2 . . . . . C,, are obtained by setting the integral of the residual multiplied by each of the functions f~ over the length of the beam equal to zero: t h a t is, L

1.6.8 Stress Analysis of Beams Using Finite Element Method The displacement model of Eq. (1.78) and the resulting element stiffness matrix of the beam, given by Eq. (1.81), can be used for the stress analysis of beams subjected to loads. The procedure is illustrated with the following example.

Example 1.5
A beam of uniform rectangular cross section with width 1 cm and depth 2 cm and length 60 cm is subjected to a vertical concentrated load of 1000 N as shown in Figure 1.12(a). If the beam is fixed at both the ends. find the stresses in the beam using a two-element idealization. Assume the Young's modulus of the beam as E = 10 r N / c m 2.

S o l u t i o n By assuming the two fixed ends of the beam as the end nodes and introducing an additional node at the point of application of the load, the beam can be replaced by a two-element idealization as shown in Figures 1.12(a) and 1.12(b). The global degrees of freedom of the beam are indicated in Figure 1.12(a) so that the vector of displacement degrees of freedom of the system (beam) is given by Wl (El)

1.7 FINITE ELEMENT PROGRAM PACKAGES The general applicability of the finite element method makes it a powerful and versatile tool for a wide range of problems. Hence, a number of computer program packages have been developed for the solution of a variety of structural and solid mechanics problems. Some of the programs have been developed in such a general manner that the same program can be used for the solution of problems belonging to different branches of engineering with little or no modification. Many of these packages represent large programs that can be used for solving real complex problems. For example, the NASTRAN (National Aeronautics and Space Administration Structural Analysis) program package contains approximately 150,000 Fortran statements and can be used to analyze physical problems of practically any size, such as a complete aircraft or an automobile structure. The availability of supercomputers (e.g., the Cray-1 and the Cyber 205) has made a strong impact on the finite element technology. In order to realize the full potential of these supercomputers in finite element computation, special parallel numerical algorithms, programming strategies, and programming languages are being developed. The use of personal computers and workstations in engineering analysis and design is becoming increasingly popular as the price of hardware is decreasing dramatically. Many finite element programs, specially suitable for the personal computer and workstation environment, have been developed. Among the main advantages are a user-friendly environment and inexpensive graphics. REFERENCES 1.1 R.

DISCRETIZATION OF THE DOMAIN

2.1 INTRODUCTION In most engineering problems, we need to find the values of a field variable such as displacement, stress, t e m p e r a t u r e , pressure, and velocity as a function of spatial coordinates (x, y, z). In the case of transient or unsteady state problems, the field variable has to be found as a function of not only the spatial coordinates (x. y,z) but also time (t). The geometry (domain or solution region) of the problem is often irregular. The first step of the finite element analysis involves the discretization of the irregular domain into smaller and regular subdomains, known as finite elements. This is equivalent to replacing the domain having an infinite number of degrees of freedom by a system having finite number of degrees of freedom.
A variety of methods can be used to model a domain with finite elements. Different methods of dividing the domain into finite elements involve different amounts of computational time and often lead to different approximations to the solution of the physical problem. The process of discretization is essentially an exercise of engineering judgment. Efficient methods of finite element idealization require some experience and a knowledge of simple guidelines. For large problems involving complex geometries, finite element idealization based on manual procedures requires considerable effort and time on the part of the analyst. Some programs have been developed for the automatic mesh generation for the efficient idealization of complex domains with minimal interface with t h e analyst.

2.2 BASIC ELEMENT SHAPES The shapes, sizes, number, and configurations of the elements have to be chosen carefully such t h a t the original body or domain is simulated as closely as possible without increasing the computational effort needed for the solution. Mostly the choice of the type of element is dictated by the geometry of the body and the number of independent coordinates necessary to describe the system. If the geometry, material properties, and the field variable of the problem can be described in terms of only one spatial coordinate, we can use the onedimensional or line elements shown in Figure 2.1(a). The t e m p e r a t u r e distribution in a rod (or fin), the pressure distribution in a pipe flow. and the deformation of a bar under axial load, for example, can be determined using these elements. Although these elements have cross-sectional area, they are generally shown schematically as a line element (Figure 2.1(b)). In some cases, the cross-sectional area of the element may be nonuniform.

Figure 2.1. For a simple analysis, one-dimensional elements are assumed to have two nodes, one at each end, with the corresponding value of the field variable chosen as the unknown (degree of freedom). However, for the analysis of beams, the values of the field variable (transverse displacement) and its derivative (slope) are chosen as the unknowns (degrees of freedom) at each node as shown in Figure 2.1(c). W h e n the configuration and other details of the problem can be described in terms of two independent spatial coordinates, we can use the two-dimensional elements shown in Figure 2.2. The basic element useful for two-dimensional analysis is the triangular element. Although a quadrilateral (or its special forms, rectangle and parallelogram) element can be obtained by assembling two or four triangular elements, as shown in Figure 2.3, in some cases the use of quadrilateral (or rectangle or parallelogram) elements proves to be advantageous. For the bending analysis of plates, multiple degrees of freedom (transverse displacement and its derivatives) are used at each node. If the geometry, material properties, and other parameters of the body can be described by three independent spatial coordinates, we can idealize the body by using the threedimensional elements shown in Figure 2.4. The basic three-dimensional element, analogous to the triangular element in the case of two-dimensional problems, is the t e t r a h e d r o n element. In some cases the hexahedron element, which can be obtained by assembling five tetrahedrons as indicated in Figure 2.5. can be used advantageously. Some problems, which are actually three-dimensional, can be described by only one or two independent coordinates. Such problems can be idealized by using an axisymmetric or ring type of elements shown in Figure 2.6. The problems that possess axial symmetry, such as pistons, storage tanks, valves, rocket nozzles, and reentry vehicle heat shields, fall into this category.

Figure 2.4. Three-Dimensional Finite Elements.
For the discretization of problems involving curved geometries, finite elements with curved sides are useful. Typical elements having curved boundaries are shown in Figure 2.7. T h e ability to model curved boundaries has been made possible bv the addition of midside nodes. Finite elements with straight sides are known as linear elements, whereas those with curved sides are called higher order elements.

2.3 DISCRETIZATION PROCESS The various considerations to be taken in the discretization process are given in the following sections [2.1].

2.3.1 Type of Elements
Often, the type of elements to be used will be evident from the physical problem. For example, if the problem involves the analvsis of a truss structure under a given set of load conditions (Figure 2.8(a)), the type of elements to be used for idealization is obviously the "bar or line elements" as shown in Figure 2.8(b). Similarly, in the case of stress analysis of the short beam shown in Figure 2.9(a). the finite element idealization can be done using three-dimensional solid elements as shown in Figure 2.9(b). However, the type of elements to be used for idealization may not be apparent, and in such cases one has to choose the type of elements judicially. As an example, consider the problem of analysis of the thin-walled shell shown in Figure 2.10(a). In this case, the shell can be idealized

by several types of elements as shown in Figure 2.10(b). Here. the nulnber of degrees of freedom needed, the expected accuracy, the ease with which the necessary equations can be derived, and the degree to whicll the pl~ysical structure can be modeled without approximation will dictate the choice of the element type to be used for idealization. In certain problems, the given bodv cannot be represented as an assemblage of only one type of elements. In such cases, we may have to use two or more types of elements for idealization. An example of this would be the analysis of an aircraft wing. Since the wing consists of top and b o t t o m covers, stiffening webs. and flanges, three types of elements, namely, triangular plate elements (for covers), rectangular shear panels (for webs), and frame elements (for flanges), have been used in the idealization shown in Figure 2.11.

2.3.2 Size of Elements The size of elements influences the convergence of the solution directly and hence it has to be chosen with care. If the size of tl~e elements is small, the final solution is expected to be more accurate. However. we have to remember that the use of elements of smaller size will also mean more computational time. Sometimes. we may have to use elements of different sizes in the same body. For example, in the case of stress analysis of the box beam shown

in Figure 2.12(a), the size of all the elements can be approximately the same. as shown in Figure 2.12(b). However, in the case of stress analysis of a plate with a hole shown in Figure 2.13(a), elements of different sizes have to be used. as shown in Figure 2.13(b). The size of elements has to be very small near the hole (where stress concentration is expected) compared to far away places. Ill general, whenever steep gradients of the field variable are expected, we have to use a finer mesh in those regions. Another characteristic related to the size of elements t h a t affects the finite element solution is the aspect ratio of the elements. The aspect ratio describes the shape of the element in the assemblage of elements. For two-dimensional elements, the aspect ratio is taken as the ratio of the largest dimension of the element to the smallest dimension. Elements with an aspect ratio of nearly unity generally yield best results [2.2].

2.3.3 Location of Nodes If the body has no abrupt changes in geometry, material properties, and external conditions (e.g., load and t e m p e r a t u r e ) , the body can be divided into equal subdivisions and hence the spacing of the nodes can be uniform. On the other hand. if there are any discontinuities in the problem, nodes have to be introduced at these discontinuities, as shown in Figure 2.14.

2.3.4 Number of Elements The n u m b e r of elements to be chosen for idealization is related to the accuracy desired. size of elements, and the n u m b e r of degrees of freedom involved. Although an increase in the n u m b e r of elements generally means more accurate results, for any given problem, there will be a certain n u m b e r of elements beyond which the accuracy cannot be improved by any significant amount. This behavior is shown graphically in Figure 2.15. Moreover, since the use of large n u m b e r of elements involves a large n u m b e r of degrees of freedom, we may not be able to store the resulting matrices in the available c o m p u t e r memory.

however, have to be incorporated in the solution procedure. This is illustrated in Figure 2.16, where only half of the plate with hole, having symmetry' in both geometry and loading, is considered for analysis.* Since there cannot be a horizontal displacement along the line of s y m m e t r y AA, the condition t h a t u = 0 has to be incorporated while finding the solution.

2.3.6 Finite Representation of Infinite Bodies
In most of the problems, like in the case of analysis of beams, plates, and shells, the boundaries of the body or continuum are clearly defined. Hence. the entire body can be considered for the element idealization. However, in some cases, as in the case of analysis of dams, foundations, and semiinfinite bodies, the boundaries are not clearly defined. In the case of dams (Figure 2.17). since the geometry is uniform and the

* In this example, even one-fourth of the plate can be considered for analysis due to symmetry about both horizontal and vertical center lines.

loading does not change in the length direction, a unit slice of the d a m can be considered for idealization and a n a h ' z e d as a plane strain problem. However, in the case of the foundation problem shown in Figure 2.18(a). we cannot idealize the complete semiinfinite soil bv finite elements. Fortunately. it is not really necessary to idealize the infinite body. Since the effect of loading decreases gradually with increasing distance from the point of loading, we can consider onh" t h a t much of the c o n t i n u u m in which the loading is e x p e c t e d to have significant effect as shown in Figure 2.18(b). Once the significant extent of the infinite b o d y is identified as shown in Figure 2.18(b), the b o u n d a r y conditions for this finite b o d y have to be i n c o r p o r a t e d in the solution. For example, if the horizontal movement only has to be restrained for sides AB and CD (i.e., u - 0), these sides are supposed to be on rollers as shown in Figure 2.18(b). In this case, the b o t t o m b o u n d a r y can be either completely fixed (u = ~' - 0) or c o n s t r a i n e d only against vertical m o v e m e n t (u - 0). T h e fixed conditions (u - t' - 0 along BC) are often used if the lower b o u n d a r y is taken at the known location of a bedrock surface. In Figure 2.18 the semiinfinite soil has been sinmlated by considering only a finite portion of the soil. In some applications, the d e t e r m i n a t i o n of the size of the finite d o m a i n m a y pose a problem. In such cases, one can use infinite elements for modeling [2.3 2.5]. As an example. Figure 2.19 shows a four-node element t h a t is infinitely long in the x direction. T h e coordinates of the nodes of this infinite element can be t r a n s f o r m e d to the n a t u r a l c o o r d i n a t e s y s t e m (.s. t) as [see Section 4.3.3 for the definition of n a t u r a l c o o r d i n a t e system] s -- 1 - 2 { 1-x "

finite element analysis of large practical systems have been made possible largely due to the banded nature of the matrices. Furthermore. since most of the matrices involved (e.g., stiffness matrices) are symmetric, the demands on the computer storage can be substantially reduced by storing only the elements involved in half bandwidth instead of storing the whole matrix. The bandwidth of the overall or global characteristic matrix depends on the node numbering scheme and the number of degrees of freedom considered per node [2.6]. If we can minimize the bandwidth, the storage requirements as well as solution time can also be minimized. Since the number of degrees of freedom per node is generally fixed for any given type of problem, the bandwidth can be minimized by using a proper node numbering scheme. As an example, consider a three-bay frame with rigid joints. 20 storeys high, shown in Figure 2.20. Assuming t h a t there are three degrees of freedom per node, there are 240 unknowns in the final equations (excluding the degrees of freedom corresponding to the fixed nodes) and if the entire stiffness matrix is stored in the computer it will require 2402 = 57.600 locations. The bandwidth (strictly speaking, half bandwidth) of the overall stiffness matrix is 15 and thus the storage required for the upper half band is only 15 x 240 = 3600 locations.

Figure 2.21. Banded Nature of the Stiffness Matrix for the Frame of Figure 2.20.
Before we a t t e m p t to minimize the bandwidth, we discuss the m e t h o d of calculating the bandwidth. For this, we consider again the rigid jointed frame shown in Figure 2.20. By applying constraints to all the nodal degrees of freedom except number 1 at node 1 (joint A), it is clear t h a t an imposed unit displacement in the direction of 1 will require constraining forces at the nodes directly connected to node A - - t h a t is, B and C. These constraining forces are nothing but the cross-stiffnesses appearing in the stiffness matrix and these forces are confined to the nodes B and C. Thus. the nonzero terms in the first row of the global stiffness matrix (Figure 2.21) will be confined to the first 15 positions. This defines the bandwidth (B) as B a n d w i d t h (B) = (maximum difference between the numbered degrees of freedom at the ends of any member + 1) This definition can be generalized so as to be applicable for any type of finite element as B a n d w i d t h (B) = (D + 1). f (2.1)

where D is the m a x i m u m largest difference in the node numbers occurring for all elements of the assemblage, and f is the number of degrees of freedom at each node. The previous equation indicates that D has to be minimized in order to minimize the bandwidth. Thus, a shorter bandwidth can be obtained simply by numbering the nodes across the shortest dimension of the body. This is clear from Figure 2.22 also,

2.5 AUTOMATIC MESH GENERATION*
As indicated in the previous section, the bandwidth of the overall system matrix depends on the manner in which the nodes are numbered. For simple systems or regions, it is easy to label the nodes so as to minimize the bandwidth. But for large systems, the procedure becomes nearly impossible. Hence. automatic mesh generation algorithms; capable of discretizing any geometry into an efficient finite element mesh without user intervention, have been developed [2.7.2.8]. Xlost commercial finite element software has built-in automatic mesh generation codes. An automatic mesh generation program generates the locations of the node points and elements, labels the nodes and elements, and provides the e l e m e n t - n o d e connectivity relationships, The automatic mesh generation schemes are usually tied to solid modeling and computer-aided design schemes. W h e n the user supplies information on the surfaces and volumes of the material domains that make up the object or system, an automatic mesh generator generates the nodes and elements in the object. The user can also specify the minimum permissible element sizes for different regions of the object.

*This section may be omitted without loss of continuity in the text material.

AUTOMATIC MESH GENERATION

69

The most common methods used in the development of automatic mesh generators are the tesselation and octree methods [2.9, 2.10]. In the tesselation method, the user gives a collection of node points and also an arbitrary starting node. The method then creates the first simplex element using the neighboring nodes. Then a subsequent or neighboring element is generated by selecting the node point that gives the least distorted element shape. The procedure is continued until all the elements are generated. The step-by-step procedure involved in this method is illustrated in Figure 2.23 for a two-dimensional example. Alternately, the user can define the boundary of the object by a series of nodes. Then the tesselation method connects selected boundary nodes to generate simplex elements. The stepwise procedure used* in this approach is shown in Figure 2.24. The octree methods belong to a class of mesh generation schemes known as tree structure methods, which are extensively used in solid modeling and computer graphics display methods. In the octree method, the object is first considered enclosed in a three-dimensional cube. If the object does not completely (uniformly) cover the cube, the cube is subdivided into eight equal parts. In the two-dimensional analog of the octree method, known as the quadtree method, the object is first considered enclosed in a square region. If the object does not completely cover the square, the square is subdivided into four equal quadrants. If any one of the resulting quadrants is full (completely occupied by the object) or empty (not occupied by the object), then it is not subdivided further. On the other hand, if any one of the resulting quadrants is partially full (partially occupied by the object), it is subdivided into four quadrants. This procedure of subdividing partially full quadrants is continued until all the resulting regions are either full or empty or until some predetermined level of resolution is achieved. At the final stage, the partially full quadrants are assumed to be either full or empty arbitrarily based on a prespecified criterion. E x a m p l e 2.1 Generate the finite element mesh for the two-dimensional object (region) shown by the crossed lines in Figure 2.25(a) using the quadtree method. S o l u t i o n First, the object is enclosed in a square region as shown by the dotted lines in Figure 2.25(a). Since the object does not occupy the complete square, the square is divided into four parts as shown in Figure 2.25(b). Since none of these parts are fully occupied by the object, each part is subdivided into four parts as shown in Figure 2.25(c). It can be seen that parts 1, 3, and 4 of A, part 3 of B. parts 2-4 of C. and parts 1-3 of D are completely occupied by the object, whereas parts 1, 2. and 4 of B and part 1 of C are empty (not occupied by the object). In addition, part 2 of A and part 4 of D are partially occupied by the object; hence, they are further subdivided into four parts each as shown in Figure 2.25(d). It can be noted that parts o and ? of part 2 (of A) and parts c~ and of part 4 (of D) are completely occupied while the remaining parts, namely 3 and a of part 2 (of A) and ~/and a of part 4 (of D), are empty. Since all the parts at this stage are either completely occupied or completely empty, no further subdivision is necessary. The corresponding quadtree representation is shown in Figure 2.25(e). Note that the shape of the finite elements is assumed to be square in this example.

t A simplex in an n-dimensional space is defined as a geometric figure having n + 1 nodes or corners. Thus, the simplex will be a triangle in a two-dimensional space and a tetrahedron in three-dimensional space.

INTERPOLATION MODELS

3.1 INTRODUCTION As stated earlier, the basic idea of the finite element m e t h o d is piecewise a p p r o x i m a t i o n - t h a t is, the solution of a complicated problem is obtained by dividing the region of interest into small regions (finite elements) and approximating the solution over each subregion by a simple function. Thus. a necessary and i m p o r t a n t step is that of choosing a simple function for the solution in each element. The functions used to represent the behavior of the solution within an element are called interpolation functions or approximating functions or interpolation models. Polynomial-type interpolation functions have been most widely used in the literature due to the following reasons:
(i) It is easier to formulate and computerize the finite element equations with polynomial-type interpolation functions. Specifically. it is easier to perform differentiation or integration with polynomials. (ii) It is possible to improve the accuracy of the results by increasing the order of the polynomial, as shown in Figure 3.1. Theoretically. a polynomial of infinite order corresponds to the exact solution. But in practice we use polynomials of finite order only as an approximation. Although trigonometric functions also possess some of these properties, they are seldom used in the finite element analvsis [3.1]. We shall consider only polynomial-type interpolation functions in this book. W h e n the interpolation polynomial is of order one. the element is termed a linear element. A linear element is called a simplex element if the number of nodes in the element is 2, 3. and 4 in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions, respectively. If the interpolation polynomial is of order two or more. the element is known as a higher order element. In higher order elements, some secondary (midside a n d / o r interior) nodes are introduced in addition to the primary (corner) nodes in order to match the number of nodal degrees of freedom with the number of constants (generalized coordinates) in the interpolation polynomial. In general, fewer higher order elements are needed to achieve the same degree of accuracy in the final results. Although it does not reduce the computational time, the reduction in the number of elements generally reduces the effort needed in the preparation of d a t a and hence the chances of errors in the input data. The higher order elements are especially useful in cases in which tile gradient of the field variable is expected to

vary rapidly. In these cases the simplex elements, which approximate the gradient by a set of constant values, do not yield good results. The combination of greater accuracy and a reduction in the d a t a preparation effort has resulted in the widespread use of higher order elements in several practical applications. We shall consider mostly linear elements in this chapter. If the order of the interpolation polynomial is fixed, the discretization of the region (or domain) can be improved by two methods. In the first method, known as the r-method, the locations of the nodes are altered without changing the total number of elements. In the second method, known as the h-method, the number of elements is increased. On the other hand, if improvement in accuracy is sought by increasing the order of the interpolation of polynomial, the m e t h o d is known as the p-method. Problems involving curved boundaries cannot be modeled satisfactorily by using straight-sided elements. The family of elements known as "isoparametric" elements has been developed for this purpose. The basic idea underlying the isoparametric elements is to use the same interpolation functions to define the element shape or geometry as well as the variation of the field variable within the element. To derive the isoparametric element equations, we first introduce a local or natural coordinate system for each element shape. Then the interpolation or shape functions are expressed in terms of the natural coordinates. The representation of geometry in terms of (nonlinear) shape functions can be considered as a mapping procedure that transforms a regular shape, such as a straight-sided triangle or rectangle in the local coordinate system, into a distorted shape. such as a curved-sided triangle or rectangle in the global Cartesian coordinate system. This concept can be used in representing problems with curved boundaries with the help

of curved-sided isoparametric elements. Today. isoparametric elements are extensively used in three-dimensional and shell analysis problems. The formulation of isoparametric elements, along with the aspect of numerical integration that is essential for c o m p u a t a t i o n s with isoparametric elements, is considered in the next chapter. 3.2 P O L Y N O M I A L F O R M OF I N T E R P O L A T I O N F U N C T I O N S If a polynomial type of variation is assumed for the field variable O(x) in a one-dimensional element, r can be expressed as

3.3 SIMPLEX, COMPLEX, AND MULTIPLEX ELEMENTS
Finite elements can be classified into three categories as simplex, complex, and multiplex elements depending on the geometry of the element and the order of the polynomial used in the interpolation function [3.2]. The simplex elements are those for which the approximating polynomial consists of constant and linear terms. Thus. the polynomials given by Eqs. (3.7)-(3.9) represent the simplex functions for one-. two-, and three-dimensional elements. Noting t h a t a simplex is defined as a geometric figure obtained by joining n + 1 joints (nodes) in an n-dimensional space, we can consider the corners of the elements as nodes in simplex elements. For example, the simplex element in two dimensions is a triangle with three nodes (corners). The three polynomial coefficients C~l, c~e, and c~3 of Eq. (3.8) can thus be expressed in terms of the nodal values of the field variable r T h e complex elements are those for which the approximating polynomial consists of quadratic, cubic, and higher order terms, according to the need, in addition to the constant and linear terms. Thus, the polynomials given by Eqs. (3.10)-(3.15) denote complex functions.

84

INTERPOLATION MODELS

Figure 3.2. Example of a Multiplex Element.

The complex elements may have the same shapes as the simplex elements but will have additional b o u n d a r y nodes and, sometimes, internal nodes. For example, the interpolating polynomial for a two-dimensional complex element (including terms up to quadratic terms) is given by Eq. (3.11). Since this equation has six unknown coefficients c~,, the corresponding complex element nmst have six nodes. Thus. a triangular element with three corner nodes and three midside nodes satisfies this requirement. The multiplex elements are those whose boundaries are parallel to the coordinate axes to achieve interelement continuity, and whose approximating polynomials contain higher order terms. The rectangular element shown in Figure 3.2 is an example of a multiplex element in two dimensions. Note t h a t the boundaries of the simplex and complex elements need not be parallel to the coordinate axes.

3.4 INTERPOLATION POLYNOMIAL IN TERMS OF NODAL DEGREES OF FREEDOM The basic idea of the finite element method is to consider a body as composed of several elements (or subdivisions) t h a t are connected at specified node points. The unknown solution or the field variable (e.g.. displacement, pressure, or t e m p e r a t u r e ) inside any finite element is assumed to be given by a simple function in terms of the nodal values of t h a t element. The nodal values of the solution, also known as nodal degrees of freedom, are treated as unknowns in formulating the system or overall equations. The solution of the system equations (e.g.. force equilibrium equations or thermal equilibrium equations or continuity equations) gives the values of the unknown nodal degrees of freedom. Once the nodal degrees of freedom are known, the solution within any finite element (and hence within the complete body) will also be known to us.
Thus, we need to express the approximating polynomial in terms of the nodal degrees of freedom of a typical finite element e. For this, let the finite element have AI nodes. W'e can evaluate the values of the field variable at the nodes by substituting the nodal coordinates into the polynomial equation given by Eqs. (3.1)-(3.3). For example, Eq. (3.1) can be expressed as o(x) - ~Tff (3.16)

Equation (3.19) now expresses the interpolating polynomial inside any finite element in terms of the nodal unknowns of that element, (~(e). A major limitation of polynomial-type interpolation functions is that one has to invert the matrix [~] to find O. and [q]-I may become singular in some cases [3.3]. The latter difficulty can be avoided by using other types of interpolation functions discussed in Chapter 4.
3.5 SELECTION OF THE ORDER OF THE INTERPOLATION POLYNOMIAL While choosing the order of the polynomial in a polynomial-type interpolation function, the following considerations have to be taken into account:

(i) The interpolation polynomial should satisfy, as far as possible, the convergence requirements stated in Section 3.6. (ii) The pattern of variation of the field variable resulting from the polynomial model should be independent of the local coordinate system. (iii) The number of generalized coordinates (a~) should be equal to the number of nodal degrees of freedom of the element (q)i).

86

INTERPOLATION MODELS

A discussion on the first consideration, namely, the convergence requirements to be satisfied by the interpolation polynomial, is given in the next section. According to the second consideration, as can be felt intuitively also, it is undesirable to have a preferential coordinate direction. T h a t is, the field variable representation within an element, and hence the polynomial, should not change with a change in the local coordinate system (when a linear transformation is made from one Cartesian coordinate system to another). This property is called geometric isotropy or geometric invariance or spatial isotropy [3.4]. In order to achieve geometric isotropy, the polynomial should contain terms t h a t do not violate symm e t r y in Figure 3.3, which is known as Pascal triangle in the case of two dimensions and Pascal t e t r a h e d r o n in the case of three dimensions. Thus, in the case of a two-dimensional simplex element (triangle). the interpolation polynomial should include terms containing both x and y. but not only one of them, in addition to the constant term. In tile case of a two-dimensional complex element (triangle), if we neglect the term x a (or x2y) for any reason, we should not include ya (or xy 2) also in order to maintain goemetric isotropy of the model. Similarly, in the case of a threedimensional simplex element (tetrahedron), the approximating polynomial should contain terms involving x, y, and z in addition to the constant term. The final consideration in selecting the order of the interpolation polynomial is to make the total number of terms involved in the polynomial equal to the number of nodal degrees of freedom of the element. The satisfaction of this requirement enables us to express the polynomial coefficients in terms of the nodal unknowns of the element as indicated in Section 3.4.

3.6 CONVERGENCE REQUIREMENTS
Since the finite element method is a numerical technique, we obtain a sequence of approximate solutions as the element size is reduced successively. This sequence will converge to the exact solution if the interpolation polynomial satisfies the following convergence requirements [3.5-3.8]: (i) The field variable must be continuous within the elements. This requirement is easily satisfied by choosing continuous functions as interpolation models. Since polynomials are inherently continuous, the polynomial type of interpolation models discussed in Section 3.2 satis~" this requirement. (ii) All uniform states of the field variable 0 and its partial derivatives up to the highest order appearing in the functional I(o) must have representation in the interpolation polynomial when. in the limit, the element size reduces to zero. The necessity of this requirement can be explained physically. The uniform or constant value of the field variable is the most elementary type of variation. Thus, the interpolation polynomial must be able to give a constant value of the field variable within the element when the nodal values are numerically identical. Similarly, when the body is subdivided into smaller and smaller elements, the partial derivatives of the field variable up to the highest order appearing in the functional* I(O) approach a constant value within each element. Thus, we * The finite element method can be considered as an approximate method of minimizing a functional I(o) in the form of an integral of tile type (

cannot hope to obtain convergence to the extact solution unless the interpolation polynomial permits this constant derivative state. In the case of solid mechanics and structural problems, this requirement states t h a t the assumed displacement model must permit the rigid body (zero strain) and the constant strain states of the element. (iii) The field variable o and its partial derivatives up to one order less t h a n the highest order derivative appearing in the functional I(o) must be continuous at element boundaries or interfaces.

We know that in the finite element m e t h o d the discrete model for the continuous function 0 is taken as a set of piecewise continuous functions, each defined over a single element. As seen in Examples 1.2-1.4. we need to evaluate integrals of the form / r---~~ da" d dec ~

to derive the element characteristic matrices and vectors. We know t h a t the integral of a stepwise continuous function, say f(:r), is defined if f(:r) remains bounded in the interval of integration. Thus. for the integral / d~-~Odx dac r

to be defined, 0 must be continuous to the order ( r - 1) to ensure that only finite j u m p discontinuities occur in the r t h derivative of o. This is precisely the requirement stated previously. The elements whose interpolation polynomials satisfy the requirements (i) and (iii) are called "compatible" or "'conforming" elements and those satisfying condition (ii) are called "complete" elements. If r t h derivative of the field variable o is continuous, then 0 is said to have C'~ continuity. In terms of this notation, the completeness requirement implies t h a t 0 must have C ~ continuity within an element, whereas the compatibility requirement implies t h a t O must have C "-1 continuity at element interfaces.* In the case of general solid and structural mechanics problems, this requirement implies t h a t the element must deform without causing openings, overlaps, or discontinuities between adjacent elements. In the case of beam. plate, and shell elements, the first derivative of the displacement (slope) across interelement boundaries also must be continuous. Although it is desirable to satisfy" all the convergence requirements, several interpolation polynomials t h a t do not meet all the requirements have been used in the finite element literature. In some cases, acceptable convergence or convergence to an incorrect. solution has been obtained. In particular, the interpolation polynomials that are complete but not conforming have been found to give satisfactory results. If the interpolation polynomial satisfies all three requirements, the approximate solution converges to the correct solution when we refine the mesh and use an increasing n u m b e r of smaller elements. In order to prove the convergence mathematically, the t This statement assumes that the functional (I) corresponding to the problem contains derivatives of 0 up to the rth order.

mesh refinement has to be made in a regular fashion so as to satisfy the following conditions: (i) All previous (coarse) meshes must be contained in the refined meshes. (ii) The elements must be made smaller in such a way that every point of the solution region can always be within an element. (iii) The form of the interpolation polynomial must remain unchanged during the process of mesh refinement. Conditions (i) and (ii) are illustrated in Figure 3.4, in which a two-dimensional region (in the form of a parallelogram) is discretized with an increasing number of triangular elements. From Figure 3.5, in which the solution region is assumed to have a curved boundary, it can be seen t h a t conditions (i) and (ii) are not satisfied if we use elements with straight boundaries. In structural problems, interpolation polynomials satisfying all the convergence requirements always lead to the convergence of the displacement solution from below while nonconforming elements may converge either from below or from above.

Notes: 1. For any physical problem, the selection of finite elements and interpolation polynomials to achieve C o continuity is not verv difficult. However, the difficulty increases rapidly when higher order continuity is required. In general, the construction of finite elements to achieve specified continuity of order C ~ C 1, C 2 . . . . . requires skill, ingenuity, and experience. Fortunately. most of the time, we would be able to use the elements already developed in an established area such as stress analysis for solving new problems. 2. The construction of an efficient finite element model involves (a) representing the geometry of the problem accurately. (b) developing a finite element mesh to reduce the bandwidth, and (c) choosing a proper interpolation model to obtain the desired accuracy in the solution. Unfortunatelv, there is no a priori m e t h o d of creating a reasonably efficient finite element model t h a t can ensure a specified degree of accuracy. Several numerical tests are available for assessing the convergence of a finite element model [3.9, 3.10]. Some adaptive finite element m e t h o d s have been developed to employ the results from previous meshes to estimate the m a g n i t u d e and distribution of solution errors and to adaptively improve the finite element model [3.11-3.15]. There are four basic approaches to adaptively improve a finite element model:
(a) Subdivide selected elements (called h-method) (b) Increase the order of the polynomial of selected elements (called p-refinement) (c) Move node points in fixed element topology (called r-refinement) (d) Define a new mesh having a better distribution of elements Various combinations of these approaches are also possible. Determining which of these approaches is the best for a particular class of problems is a complex problem t h a t must consider the cost of the entire solution process.

The interpolation function N, corresponds to the ith nodal degree of freedom (I)(e) and only the sum represents the variation of the field variable inside

the element in terms of the nodal degrees of freedom (Pl e) In fact. the interpolation function corresponding to the ith nodal degree of freedom (Ni) assumes a value of 1 at node i and 0 at all the other nodes of the element.

It can be shown t h a t N~(x, y) = 0 at nodes j and k. and at all points on the line passing t h r o u g h these nodes. Similarly, the shape functions N a and Nk have a value of 1 at nodes j and k, respectively, and 0 at other nodes. 2. Since the interpolation functions are linear in x and y. the gradient of the field variable in x or y direction will be a constant. For example,

O,(x,y)
Ox

0 ~(e) = ox[N(x,y)] - ( b ~ ( P , + ba(P, + b k ' ~ k ) / 2 A

(3.38)

Since (I)i, (I)j, and (I)k are the nodal values of O ( i n d e p e n d e n t of x and y) and bi, bj, and bk are constants whose values are fixed once the nodal coordinates are specified, ( O 0 / O x ) will be a constant. A constant value of the gradient of 0 within an element m e a n s t h a t m a n y small elements have to be used in locations where rapid changes are expected in the value of r

3.7.3 Three-Dimensional Simplex Element
T h e three-dimensional simplex element is a flat-faced t e t r a h e d r o n with four nodes, one at each corner, as shown in Figure 3.8. Let the nodes be labeled as i. j, k, and l, where i, j, and k are labeled in a counterclockwise sequence on any face as viewed from the vertex opposite this face, which is labeled as l. Let the values of the field variable be r ~ j , ~k, and (I)t and the global coordinates be ( x ~ , y i . z , ) . ( x j , y j . z j ) , ( X k , y k , Z k ) , and (xl, Yl, zt) at nodes i, j, k, and l, respectively. If the variation of O(x, g, z) is assumed to be linear,

r

the nodal conditions 0 = ~, at ( x i , y i , z ~ ) , 0 = (Pa at ( x a , y a . z j ) . o = 4Pk at ( x k , y k , z k ) , and O = (Pl at (xz, yt, zl) produce the system of equations
