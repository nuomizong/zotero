A FINITE ELEMENT METHOD FOR STIFFENED PLATES

Abstract. The aim of this paper is to analyze a low order ﬁnite element method for a stiﬀened
plate. The plate is modeled by Reissner-Mindlin equations and the stiﬀener by Timoshenko beams equations. The resulting problem is shown to be well posed. In the case of concentric stiﬀeners it decouples into two problems, one for the in-plane plate deformation and the other for the bending of the plate. The analysis and discretization of the ﬁrst one is straightforward. The second one is shown to have a solution bounded above and below independently of the thickness of the plate. A discretization based on DL3 ﬁnite elements combined with ad-hoc elements for the stiﬀener is proposed. Optimal order error estimates are proved for displacements, rotations and shear stresses for the plate and the stiﬀener. Numerical tests are reported in order to assess the performance of the method. These numerical computations demonstrate that the error estimates are independent of the thickness, providing a numerical evidence that the method is locking-free.

Introduction
A stiﬀened plate is a plate reinforced with ribs to increase it capacity to resist loads. Such plates are used typically in buildings, hulls of ships, aircraft and many other applications in the structural engineering. Diﬀerent models of stiﬀened plates have been used. See for instance [17] for a discussion of several simple engineering models and further references. Another approach has been proposed in [20]. It consists of coupling Kirchhoﬀ-Love equations for the plate with Euler-Bernoulli equations for the stiﬀener. The constraint between both structures is imposed by means of Lagrange multipliers. A particular ﬁnite element method is proposed. Numerical experiments demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of this approach although no analysis is given. The same problem has been analyzed in [11] based in a model proposed in [18]. In this case C 1 −elements are proposed for the plate combined with P2 − P3 elements for the beam. A domain decomposition technique is proposed for the solution of the resulting algebraic problem. An alternative modeling approach consists of using Reissner-Mindlin equations for the plate and Timoshenko beam equations for the stiﬀener. This model has been considered in [19], where an elementary ﬁnite element method is proposed. However this method is shown to suﬀer from locking. Locking consists in that very unsatisfactory results are obtained when the thickness is small with respect to the other dimension of the structure. From the point of view of the numerical analysis, locking reveals itself in

that the a priori estimates depends on the thickness of the structure in a such way that they degenerate when this parameter become small. Several ﬁnite elements have been proposed to avoid locking in Reissner-Mindlin equations (see [7] for a review on this subject). A typical locking-free ﬁnite element method, MITC9, which was introduced in [5], is proposed in [17] to discretize the stiﬀened plate equations. These elements are combined with standard quadratic element for the stiﬀener. Once more, only numerical evidence of the performance of the method is reported. In the present paper we use the same model, based on Reissner-Mindlin equations for the plate and Timoshenko equations for the stiﬀener. We introduce the constraint between both structures by means of Lagrange multipliers. We prove existence and uniqueness of solution to the resulting problem. A particular case of stiﬀened plates is when the mid-line of the stiﬀener lies on the mid-surface of the plate. In this case the plate is known as concentrically stiﬀened and the problem decomposes into two simpler problems as it happens for unstiﬀened plates: the in-plane and the bending plate problems. The analysis of the former is quite simple since it leads to equations independent of the plate thickness. This is not the case with the bending problem for the stiﬀened plate. In this case we consider a family of problems parametrized by the plate thickness t. We show that the mechanical coeﬃcients of the stiﬀener must be taken proportional to 1/t to obtain a signiﬁcant limit problem as t goes to zero. We show that the solution of the stiﬀened plate bending problem is bounded above and below far from zero, independently of t. We also prove additional regularity of the solution, although not independently of t. For the discretization of the in-plane stiﬀened plate we use standard linear elements, and the analysis is straightforward. For the stiﬀened plate bending problem we use a low order plate ﬁnite element, DL3 [12], combined with P2 − P1 elements for the stiﬀener. The choice of these hybrid elements for the rod allows us to impose the constraint in an simpler way. We prove optimal order error estimates depending on higher order norms of the solution. These higher order norms are the same that appear in the case of uncoupled plates and rods. In such a case they are bounded independently of t. For the stiﬀened plate bending problem we prove that these higher order norms are bounded, although in principle these bounds could depend on t. We report a thorough numerical experimentation which gives numerical evidence that this is not the case, allowing us to assess the locking-free character of the method. The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 1 we present the mathematical setting of the load problem and prove existence and uniqueness. In Section 2 we analyze the concentrically stiﬀened plate and prove stability results, independent of the plate thickness for the in-plane and bending plate problems. In Section 3 we present the ﬁnite element discretizations of both problems, we obtain error estimates for the former and prove that the latter is well posed. In Section 4 we focus on the stiﬀened loading plate problem for which we prove error estimates. In Section 5 we report numerical results which allow us to assess the performance of the proposed method. First, to validate our code, we apply it to a vibration problem which was also solved in [17]. Secondly we apply the proposed method to a couple of problems whose limit behavior as the thickness becomes small is known. Finally we apply it to a family of problems which allow us to demonstrate that the method is locking-free.

1. The Problem of the Stiffened Plate
We consider a plate entirely crossed by a rod which act as a stiﬀener. We restrict our attention to plates with constant thickness and rods with uniform cross section. If the mid-line of the rod lies on the mid-surface of the plate we call it a concentrically stiﬀened plate. Otherwise it is called an eccentrically stiﬀened plate (see Figure 1). Most of this paper is devoted to concentrically stiﬀened plates except for the present section which is valid for eccentrically stiﬀened plates too. We consider a coordinate system such that the plate occupies the domain Ω × (−t/2, t/2), where t > 0 is the plate thickness and Ω is the mid-surface of the plate, which is assumed to be polygonal. Moreover we assume that the coordinate system is such that the mid-line of the rod lies on the plane y = 0. We denote by r the distance between the rod mid-line and the plate mid-surface (r = 0 for concentrically stiﬀened plates). The problem will

Figure 2. Geometry of a stiﬀened plate We restrict our analysis to the case of a plate modeled by Reissner-Mindlin equations and completely clamped by its lateral boundary ∂Ω. We denote by u = (u1 , u2 ), w and β = (β1 , β2 ) the mid-surface in-plane plate displacements, the transverse displacements and the rotations, respectively. In its turn, us , v s , ws denote the s s s stiﬀener displacements in each coordinate direction and, θx , θy and θz the stiﬀener rotations with respect to each axis. To derive the equations of the stiﬀened plate we will obtain ﬁrst an expression for its total energy. With this aim, we add the corresponding energies of the plate and the stiﬀener. However, for the latter, the shear and bending terms in the plane of the plate are typically neglected (see [17]). We consider a load acting on the plate, and denote by f its in-plane component, and by g the transverse one. Therefore, the total energy including the works of the loads reads Et := t3 t a1 (u, u) + a2 (β, β) + t 2 2 +

are the plane strain and plane stress bilinear forms, respectively. Above (v) := 1 (Dv + Dv t ) denotes the 2 E linearized strain tensor and the coeﬃcients E and ν are the Young and Poisson moduli. Moreover µ := 2(1+ν) is the shear modulus of the plate. On the other hand, A is the area of the stiﬀener section, Iyy and Izz are the second moments of area with respect to y- and z-axes, respectively, J := Iyy + Izz , E s and ν s the Young and Es Poisson moduli of the stiﬀener and µs := 2(1+ν s ) the shear modulus. Finally κ and κs are the shear correction factors for the plate and the rod, respectively . All the parameters are strictly positive constants. In the case of the stiﬀener this corresponds to a rod of arbitrary uniform section. Notice that, since the bending and shear energy of the stiﬀener have been neglected, the variables v s and θz do not appear in the expression for the total energy. 2 1 The appropriate functional spaces for displacements and rotations are the following: u, β ∈ H0 (Ω) ; w ∈ 2 s s 1 1 H0 (Ω); us , ws , θx , θy ∈ H0 (Γ). For the loads we consider f ∈ L2 (Ω) and g ∈ L2 (Ω). The stiﬀened plate problem is obtained by minimizing the total energy subject to the following kinematic constraints: u1 = us − rβ1 , w=w , β2 = β1 =

The constraint (1.2) comes from the fact that the plate and the rod are joint monolithically. Moreover, the rotations of the plate and the stiﬀener are the same in this model, which leads to (1.3) and (1.4). Finally (1.1) can be easily deduced. In fact, using the notation from Figure 3, we have that u1 us = . r+e e Therefore approximating −β1 by

It is well known that the standard ﬁnite element methods applied to plates or rods are subject to “numerical locking”. This means that they lead to unacceptable poor results for thin structures, unless the mesh size is excessively small. The standard methodology to deal with locking-free methods is to consider a family of problems depending on a small parameter: the plate thickness t. A method will be locking-free if the error estimates do not deteriorate as the thickness becomes small. In our case, to avoid dealing with more than one parameter, we restrict our attention to a stiﬀener such that ˜ A = t2 A, ˜ Iyy = t4 Iyy and ˜ J = t4 J, (1.11)

˜ ˜ ˜ where A, Iyy and J are constants. This corresponds to a rod with a section having width and height proportional to t. The stiﬀening eﬀect of such a rod tends to disappear as t tends to zero. To avoid this and obtaining a proper limit problem, we assume that the physical parameters of the rod increase as t tends to zero. More precisely we assume that ˜ Es , (1.12) Es = t ˜ where E s is a ﬁxed constant. See [11] for a similar choice in the case of Kirchhoﬀ stiﬀened plates. Correspondingly ˜ Es we deﬁne µs := 1+ν s so that µs = µs . Scalings (1.11) and (1.12) ensure that if the loads are scaled as usual for ˜ ˜ plates, then the solution of problem (1.9)–(1.10) attains a limit as t tends to zero and that, in the limit problem, the rod remains as a stiﬀener. This will be clearly seen in the numerical examples of Section 5, where diﬀerent scalings of the physical parameters are considered. It is shown therein that (1.12) leads to a stiﬀened limit problem (Test 4) whereas other scalings lead either to a vanishing or to a perfectly rigid stiﬀener (Section 5.2). Using these scalings we write the bilinear form A as follows: A (U , V ) = ta1 (u, v) + t3 a2 (β, η) + t

We are interested in proving the existence and uniqueness of the solution to problem (1.9)–(1.10). For this purpose we will show the ellipticity of A (·, ·) in the whole space H and the inf-sup condition for B (·, ·) in appropriate spaces. Throughout the paper C will denote a strictly positive constant, not necessarily the same at each occurrence, but always independent of t and the mesh-size h, which will be introduced in the next section. For the existence and uniqueness, we consider the continuous problem (1.9)–(1.10) with 0 < t ≤ 1 ﬁxed. The bilinear form A (·, ·) is elliptic in H, with an ellipticity constant depending of t: A (V , V ) ≥ C t3 η

The inequalities (1.14) and (1.15) are consequences of Korn’s inequalities, whereas (1.16) is a classical result, (see [6]). In its turn, (1.17)–(1.19) follow from the scalings (1.11)–(1.12), Poincar´ inequality and a straightforward e s 2 computation for Γ dz + ϕs (see [1]). y dx

which, since r is bounded above, leads to S ≥ C χ4

The inequality above together with (1.21) and (1.20) allow us to prove the inf-sup condition for B. This condition and the global ellipticity of A allow us to use the standard theory for mixed problems (see [6]) to conclude the following theorem: Theorem 1.1. For any t > 0 ﬁxed, problem (1.9)–(1.10) has a unique solution (U , λ) ∈ H × Q. Remark 1.2. Solution to problem (1.9)–(1.10) is bounded in terms of F H . However, in principle, this bound is not necessarily uniform with respect to t, since the ellipticity and continuity constants of the bilinear form A depend on diﬀerent powers of the thickness (see [6, Prop. II.1.3]).

2. Concentrically stiffened plates
The analysis of the previous section is valid for concentrically as well as eccentrically stiﬀened plates. For the latter, in-plane and transverse terms are fully coupled and each one involve diﬀerent scales with respect to the thickness. In this regard, this resembles what happens in the shell problem, for which the analysis is much less mature than for plates. This is the reason why, from now on, we restrict our attention to concentrically stiﬀened plates (i.e, r = 0, see Figure 2). In this case, the plate problem decomposes into two uncoupled ones: the in-plane and the bending stiﬀened plate problems, as it happens for non stiﬀened plates. In fact, the in-plane displacements u and us relate with the remaining variables only through equation (1.5) which is part of (1.10) and this happen only if r = 0. For r = 0 we are led to the following two uncoupled problems, the ﬁrst one for the in-plane terms and the second one for the bending terms: 2 1 1 Find (u, us ) ∈ H0 (Ω) × H0 (Γ) and λ1 ∈ H −1/2 (Γ) such that ta1 (u, v) + t

˜ ˜ ˜ From now on, to simplify a bit the notation, we set all the following constants equal to one: A, Iyy , J, κ, κs , ˜ s , µs , as well as E (which appears in the deﬁnition of a1 and a2 ). Moreover, we consider values of t ranging E ˜ in (0, 1]. Since these constants have been assumed to be independent of t, this does not aﬀect any subsequent asymptotic analysis. Moreover to obtain a family of problems uniformly stable with respect to t, we consider a transverse load proportional to t2 , namely g = g t2 ˜ (2.5) with g independent of t. Finally, it is also convenient for the analysis to rescale the Lagrange multipliers ˜ according to the scales of the diﬀerent problems in which they appear: ˜ λ1 = λ1 t and ˜ λi = λi t3 , i = 2, 3, 4. (2.6)

In what follows we analyze the resulting rescaled problems.

2.1. Stiﬀened in-plane plate problem
Using the scaling (2.6) in (2.1)–(2.2) and setting the constants equal to one, we obtain the following rescaled ˜ problem, in which we omit the tildes in λ1 to simplify the notation: 2 1 1 Find (u, us ) ∈ H0 (Ω) × H0 (Γ) and λ1 ∈ H −1/2 (Γ) such that a1 (u, v) +

This problem has a unique solution. In fact, this is a consequence of Theorem 1.1 and the equivalence of problem (1.9)–(1.10) with (2.7)–(2.8) and (2.10)–(2.11) in the case r = 0. However, this theorem does not imply that the solution is bounded independently of t (cf. Remark 1.2). Our next goal is to prove that, for a non vanishing g, the solution of problem (2.10)–(2.11) is bounded above and below far from zero, both uniformly with respect to t.

In what follows we present some regularity results associated to the stiﬀened bending plate problem. First, we deﬁne the shear terms in the plate and the stiﬀener as follows: γ := 1 ( w − β) , t2 1 dws s α := 2 + θy . t dx

Moreover, γ|Ωi ∈ H 1 (Ωi ) , i = 1, 2, and α ∈ H 3/2 (Γ). 1 Proof. Testing (2.10) with ϕs ∈ H0 (Γ) and setting to zero all the other test functions, we have x s d2 θ x = λ3 ∈ H −1/2 (Γ) 2 dx

(2.28)

s and hence θx ∈ H 3/2 (Γ). In a similar way, testing (2.10) with z s = 0 and ϕs = 0, we obtain that α ∈ H 1/2 (Γ) y s and θy ∈ H 3/2 (Γ), respectively. Consequently, (2.27) yields ws ∈ H 3/2 (Γ). Next we extend ws to the whole 1 domain Ω in such a way that the extension belongs to H 2 of each subdomain Ωi . More precisely, let w0 ∈ H0 (Ω) 2 be such that w0 |Ωi ∈ H (Ωi ), i = 1, 2, (see [16, Theorem 1.5.2.8]) and

w 0 |Γ = w s .

1 1 ˜ ˜ Since β|Γ = β 0 |Γ and w|Γ = w0 |Γ , we have that β|Ωi ∈ H0 (Ωi ) and w|Ωi ∈ H0 (Ωi ), i = 1, 2.

These extensions, that 2 1 1 we also denote η and z, clearly satisfy η ∈ H0 (Ω) and z ∈ H0 (Ω). If we take such η and z with vanishing z s , s s ϕx and ϕy in (2.10), we obtain that

Notice that F ∈ L2 (Ω) and G ∈ L2 (Ω), because β 0 |Ωi ∈ H 2 (Ωi ) and w0 |Ωi ∈ H 2 (Ωi ). Hence, using the 2 ˜ ˜ regularity results of [2, Theorem 2.1], we have that (β, w) ∈ H 2 (Ωi ) × H 2 (Ωi ), which using (2.29) yields the regularity for β. The next step is to prove additional regularity for γ and α. With this aim, we observe ﬁrst that by using the 2 deﬁnition of γ in (2.26) and the regularity of β and w we have that γ|Ωi ∈ H 1 (Ωi ) , i = 1, 2. 1 On the other hand, testing problem (2.30) with z ∈ H0 (Ωi ) and η = 0, we obtain that − div γ = g in Ωi .

where [[·]] denotes the jump across Γ. Consequently, from the regularity of γ, we obtain λ2 ∈ H 1/2 (Γ). Therefore, 1 testing (2.10) with z s ∈ H0 (Γ) and all the other variables set to zero, we have that α = λ2 and hence 2 1 α ∈ H 3/2 (Γ).

Consequently, since β|Ωi ∈ H 2 (Ωi ), i = 1, 2, we obtain that λ3 , λ4 ∈ H 1/2 (Γ). Therefore, from (2.28) and the s s s analogous expression for θy , we obtain that θx and θy are in H 5/2 (Γ). Finally from these regularity results, s (2.27) and the additional regularity of α, we obtain w ∈ H 5/2 (Γ) and conclude the proof. Remark 2.3. According to Proposition 2.2, the solution of problem (2.10)–(2.11) satisﬁes additional regularity. However, we have not proved that the corresponding norms are bounded independently of t. Indeed, we have used that λ2 , λ3 and λ4 belong to H −1/2 (Γ), which is true but we do not have bounds of λ2 −1/2,Γ , λ3 −1/2,Γ and λ4 −1/2,Γ independent of t (cf. Remark 1.2). In spite of this, the numerical results in Section 5 seem to suggest that such bounds should hold true.

3. The discrete problems
We consider separately the discretization of the stiﬀened in-plane and bending problems. Let {Th } be a regular family of triangulations consistent with Γ, in the sense that, for all meshes, Γ is a union of edges of Γ Γ Th . Let Th be the partition induced by Th in Γ. We assume that the family {Th } is such that Th is quasi uniform.

3.1. Stiﬀened in-plane plate problem
We deﬁne:
1 Xh := zh ∈ H0 (Ω) : zh |T ∈ P1 ∀T ∈ Th , 1 Γ Pkh := vh ∈ H0 (Γ) : vh | ∈ Pk ∀ ∈ Th ,

k ∈ N,

where Pk denotes the polynomials of degree at most k. Let X h := Xh × Xh . The discrete analogue to problem (2.7)–(2.8) reads: Find (uh , us ) ∈ X h × P1h and λ1h ∈ P1h such that h a1 (uh , v h ) +

1 1 Since X h ⊂ H0 (Ω) and P1h ⊂ H0 (Γ), by virtue of (2.9) we only need to prove the following inf-sup condition to be able to apply the classical Babuˇka-Brezzi theory: s Γ sup vh s ∈X ×P 0=(v h ,vh ) h 1h s χh (v1h − vh ) ≥ C χh s 1,Ω + vh 1,Γ

Notice that ISZ (Evh ) = vh ∀ vh ∈ P1h . (3.5)

Now we are in the a position to deﬁne the Fortin operator ¯ Π (v, v s ) := ((ISZ (E (ˆ ( v1 |Γ ))) , ISZ v2 ) , π v s ) . π ˆ As a consequence of (3.3), (3.4) and the boundedness of the operators E and ISZ , we have ¯ Π (v, v s )

Γ

¯ Therefore Π satisﬁes the assumptions of the Fortin lemma [14]. Consequently the Babuˇka-Brezzi theory (see s for instance [6]) allows us to prove the next theorem. Theorem 3.1. Problem (3.1)–(3.2) has a unique solution (uh , us , λ1h ) ∈ X h × P1h × P1h and there exists a h positive constant C such that, if (u, us ) is the solution to problem (2.7)–(2.8), then u − uh

The error estimate above depends as usual on additional regularity of the solution to the continuous problem 1 (2.7)–(2.8). In what follows we derive a simpler form of this problem. By testing (2.7) with v s ∈ H0 (Γ) and setting the other variables to zero we have − d2 u s = λ1 ∈ H −1/2 (Γ) dx2

and hence, us ∈ H 3/2 (Γ). Moreover, from (2.8), u1 = us on Γ. On the other hand, using diﬀerent test functions in (2.7) it can be shown that [[σ (u) n]]Γ = λ1 0
2

(3.6)

Eν E 1 where σ (u) := 1+ν (u) + (1+ν)(1−2ν) (div u)I is the plane-stress stress tensor. Therefore, u ∈ H0 (Ω) is the solution to the following problem:

− div (σ (u)) = f ∈ L2 (Ωi ) , u1 = u ∈ ∂u2 ∂n =0
s 1/2 H00

i = 1, 2,

This can be seen as the coupling of two elliptic problems, one in each subdomain Ωi , i = 1, 2, with a Dirichlet boundary condition for the component u1 and a transmission condition for u2 . It seems reasonable to expect E additional regularity for the solution to this problem. In such a case, λ1 = 2(1+ν) ∂u1 + ∂u2 would be more ∂y ∂x regular, too.

3.2. The stiﬀened bending plate problem
To discretize this problem we consider the DL3 element introduced in [12]. For each T ∈ Th , let µ1 , µ2 , µ3 be its barycentric coordinates. We denote by τi a unit tangent vector to the edge µi = 0 and deﬁne p 1 = µ2 µ3 τ 1 , Let
1 Y h := η ∈ H0 (Ω) : η|T ∈ P1 ⊕ p1 , p2 , p3 2

p2 = µ1 µ3 τ 2 ,

p3 = µ1 µ2 τ 3 .

Lemma 3.2. Problem (3.10)–(3.11) has a unique solution.

where we have used (3.8) and (3.9) to obtain the last two terms. Thus we conclude the lemma. ˆ Next step consists in deﬁning β and w so that appropriate error estimates hold for the right hand side of ˆ s (4.5). With this aim we will use the Lagrange interpolant IL of diﬀerent functions β1 , β2 , w, θx , etc. This interpolant is well deﬁned because of the additional regularity proved in Proposition 2.2. Moreover, for each edge of the triangulation, let t be a unit tangent vector and b the piecewise quadratic bubble associated to , so that b t is a tangential bubble as deﬁned in (3.7). ˆ To deﬁne β we use the Lagrange interpolant of β enriched with quadratic tangential bubbles so that, for all edges , ˆ β·t = β·t .

5. Numerical Experiments
In this section we report some numerical results obtained with a code which implements the method proposed above. The aim of the numerical experimentation is to assess the performance of the method. The error estimate from Theorem 4.2 involves higher order norms of quantities which are known to be bounded (cf. Proposition 2.2). These bound are independent of the thickness t for uncoupled plates [2] and rods [3]. However analogous thickness-independent bounds have not been proved for a stiﬀened plate. Therefore, one of the goals of the reported numerical experimentation is to test whether the method is actually locking-free. To solve

Figure 4. Square plate. Finite element mesh (N = 4). problem (3.10)–(3.11), ﬁrst we eliminate the Lagrange multipliers and impose the constraints by writing the variables corresponding to the stiﬀener in terms of those of the plate. In fact, (3.11) implies that
s wh = wh , s θxh = β2h , s θyh = −β1h

on Γ.

Thus, problem (3.10)–(3.11) turns out to be equivalent to the following one, in which we included again the physical constants that have been set to 1 for the analysis: t3 a2 (β h , η h ) + t +

Let us remark that the stiﬀness matrix of the problem can be easily obtained by static condensation from the separate corresponding stiﬀness matrices of the plate and the rod. In all tests, we considered a square plate of side length 60 cm. The stiﬀener crosses the plate joining the mid-points of two opposite edges. We use uniform meshes obtained by reﬁning the coarse one shown in Figure 4. The parameter N represents the number of elements on each side of the plate. We took κ = κs = 1 as correction factors in the plate and the stiﬀener, respectively, for all the tests.

5.1. Test 1: A free vibration problem for a clamped stiﬀened plate
Since no analytical solution for the load problem of the stiﬀened plate is available to compare with, we used a vibration problem solved in [17] by means of MITC9 elements. For the vibration problem, we have to consider the mass terms of the plate and the stiﬀener instead of the load terms. Thus, the vibration problem consists in ﬁnding ωh > 0 and (wh , β h ) ∈ Wh × Y h such that t3 a2 (β h , η h ) + t

where ωh is the unknown vibration frequency and ρ and ρs are the densities of the plate and the stiﬀener, respectively. We applied the method to a square clamped stiﬀened plate with the same physical and geometrical

22 parameters as in [17]:

t = 1 mm, E = E s = 68.85 × 109 Pa, ν = ν s = 0.34, ρ = ρs = 2780 kg/m3 , A = 67 mm2 , Iyy = 2290 mm4 , J = 22.33 mm4 . Table 1 shows the six lowest vibration frequencies computed with the method on four successively reﬁned meshes. The table includes extrapolated frequencies and the order of convergence in powers of h estimated by means of a least squares ﬁtting. It also includes the frequencies computed in [17] with MITC9 elements. Table 1. Test 1: Lowest vibration frequencies of a square clamped stiﬀened plate.

We observe a very good agreement between the values computed with both methods. On the other hand, a quadratic order of convergence can be clearly appreciated. Since typically the order of convergence of the eigenvalues doubles that of the load problem, this corresponds to O(h) for the latter, which is the optimal one for the elements we have used.

5.2. Test 2: Robustness with respect to the stiﬀener properties
The aim of this test is to assess the robustness of the method with respect to the physical parameters of the stiﬀener. We considered two asymptotics with respect to the thickness t. In the ﬁrst one, the stiﬀener rigidity increases as t becomes smaller. As discussed above, the proper scaling for attaining a limit as t goes to zero is to take E s proportional to 1/t (cf. (1.12)). Instead we used E s := E/t2 for this experiment, so that, in the limit as t goes to zero, this problem corresponds to that of a clamped plate also clamped along its mid-line Γ. The material and the stiﬀener cross-sectional properties were taken as follows: A = t2 , Iyy = t4 /12, J = t4 /6, E = 68.85 × 109 Pa, ν = ν s = 0.34. The load was taken as constant on the whole plate: g = 106 N/m4 t2 . We took various decreasing values of the thickness ranging from 10 to 0.01 mm. We compared the transverse displacement wh and the rotation β h computed with the present method with those corresponding to the plate

c clamped along Γ, which were computed by DL3 elements [12]. We denote the latter by wh and β c . We measure h the deviation between both models by means of the relative diﬀerences c |wh − wh |1,Ω c |wh |1,Ω

and

|β h − β c |1,Ω h |β c |1,Ω h

computed on the mesh corresponding to N = 64. It can be clearly seen that the relative diﬀerences decreases linearly with the thickness t. Moreover, this experiment shows that the stiﬀened plate behaves as expected in this limit case. Table 2. Test 2: Comparison of stiﬀened plates with an almost rigid and a perfectly rigid stiﬀener.
Thickness (m) 10−2 10−3 10−4 10−5

As a second experiment we took E s = E and the same values as above for A, Iyy , J, E and ν. In this case, as t becomes smaller, the eﬀect of the stiﬀener tends to disappear. In fact, A = t2 corresponds to a rod section with width and height proportional to t. In the limit as t goes to zero this problem correspond to that of an unstiﬀened plate. Once more we took values of t ranging from 10 to 0.01mm and we compared the transverse displacements and the rotations computed with the present method with those of the unstiﬀened plate computed f by DL3 elements. We denote the latter by wh and β f . We report in Table 3 the relative diﬀerences between h both models computed again on the mesh corresponding to N = 64. Table 3. Test 2: Comparison of a stiﬀened plate with a very soft stiﬀener and a plate without a stiﬀener.

Once more, it can be clearly observed a linear dependence with respect to t. Once more, the behavior of this softly stiﬀened plates agrees with what is expected. On the other hand, Tables 2 and 3 show that the method is thoroughly robust with respect to the physical parameters of the stiﬀener. Moreover, in both cases the results do not deteriorate as t becomes smaller, which suggests that the method is locking-free.

5.3. Test 3: Testing the locking-free character of the method
The main goal of this test is to conﬁrm experimentally that the method is locking-free. In this case we took the scaling E s := E/t, which allows us to achieve a well posed limit problem. We computed a very accurate approximation of the solution with the mesh corresponding to N = 64 and we took it as an ‘exact’ solution. We denote by we the corresponding transverse displacement. We estimated the error of the numerical solutions computed on coarse meshes (N = 8, 12, 16) by means of |we − wh |1,Ω . We report in Table 4 the values of |we − wh |1,Ω for diﬀerent meshes and decreasing values of the thickness. We also include the orders of convergence estimated by means of a least squares ﬁtting and, in the last row, the extrapolated limit values corresponding to t = 0.

Figure 5. Test 4: Transverse displacement ﬁeld computed with the proposed method (N = 16) We observe that the method is perfectly locking-free and that an order of convergence close to one is attained even for extremely small values of the thickness. Thus, this experiment provides a solid numerical evidence of the locking-free character of the method. Figure 5 shows the transverse displacement ﬁeld of the stiﬀened plate reported in Table 4 for t = 0.001 m and N = 16. In this case the relation E s /E = 104 . The eﬀect of the stiﬀener can be clearly appreciated.

6. Conclusions
We analyzed the load problem of the clamped stiﬀened plate modeled by Reissner-Mindlin equations. We restricted our analysis to the case of concentrically stiﬀened plates, in which the mid-line of the stiﬀener lies on the mid-surface of the plate. In such a case, the problem decouples into two well posed problems: a stiﬀened in-plate plate problem and a stiﬀened bending plate problem. We propose a ﬁnite element method based on a standard linear triangular elements for the in-plane problem and DL3 elements for the bending problem. The analysis of the former is straightforward, since it turns out a standard elliptic problem not depending on the plate thickness. The analysis of the bending problem is more involved. We proved optimal order error estimates for all the quantities in terms of higher order norms of these quantities. We proved that these higher order norms are bounded with bounds in principle depending on the plate thickness. Because of this, the main goal of the numerical experimentation was to assess the locking-free character of the method. The numerical tests also conﬁrmed the optimal order of convergence and showed the robustness of the method with respect to the physical parameters of the stiﬀener.
