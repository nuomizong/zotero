Abstract The cell-based strain smoothing technique is combined with the well-known three-node Mindlin plate element (MIN3) to give a so-called the cell-based smoothed MIN3 (CS-MIN3) for static and free vibration analyses of plates. In the process of formulating the system stiffness matrix of the CS-MIN3, each triangular element will be divided into three sub-triangles, and in each sub-triangle, the stabilized MIN3 is used to compute the strains and to avoid the transverse shear locking. Then the strain smoothing technique on whole the triangular element is used to smooth the strains on these three sub-triangles. The numerical examples demonstrated that the CS-MIN3 is free of shear locking, passes the patch test and shows four superior properties such as: (1) be a strong competitor to many existing three-node triangular plate elements in the static analysis, (2) can give high accurate solutions for problems with skew geometries in the static analysis, (3) can give high accurate solutions in free vibration analysis, (4) can provide accurately the values of high frequencies of plates by using only coarse meshes.

1 Introduction In the past 50 years, many of plate bending elements based on the Mindlin–Reissner theory using the ﬁrst-order shear deformation (FSDT) has been proposed by researchers. Such a large amount of elements can be found in literatures [1–10], and in recent papers [11–14]. In formulations of a Mindlin– Reissner plate element using the FSDT, the deﬂection w and rotations βx , β y are independent functions and required at least to be C0-continuous. Due to the complexity of existing plate elements, research on simpler, more efﬁcient and inexpensive plate elements receives continuously strong interest. Compared with quadrilateral elements, three-node triangular plate elements are particularly attractive because of its simplicity, easy in automatic meshing and re-meshing in adaptive analysis. These elements usually possess high accuracy and fast convergence speed for displacement solutions. However for stresses or internal forces, they usually give the low accuracy [15–17] and need a post-process to improve the solution [18,19]. In addition, the main difﬁculty encountered of these elements is the phenomenon of shear locking which induces over-stiffness as the plate becomes progressively thinner. In order to avoid shear locking, many new numerical techniques and effective modiﬁcations have been proposed and tested, such as the reduced integration and selective reduced integration schemes proposed by Zienkiewicz et al. [20] and Hughes et al. [21,22]; the stabilization procedure proposed by Belytschko et al. [23,24]; free formulation

method proposed by Bergan and Wang [25], the substitute shear strain method proposed by Hinton and Huang [26], mixed formulation/hybrid elements [27–30]; etc. However, these elements are still subjected to some drawbacks such as instability due to rank deﬁciency or low accuracy or complex performance. In order to overcome these drawbacks, Hughes and Tezduzar [31] introduced an assumed natural strain (ANS) method which allows deﬁning the shear strains independently from the approximation of kinematic variables. In this method, the shear strain ﬁeld of a 4-node quadrilateral element is interpolated independently by rational constant shear strains along each element side, and the shear locking problem will be overcome. It has been proved to be mathematically valid by Bathe and Brezzi [32,33] and Brezzi et al. [34]. Based on this method, many successful models were then presented, including the mixed interpolated tensorial components (MITC) family proposed by Bathe’s group [32–38]; the discrete Reissner–Mindlin family [39,40] and the linked interpolation elements (Q4BL [41] and T3BL [42]) by Zienkiewicz’s group; discrete Kirchhoff elements DKT [43] and DKQ [44] proposed by Batoz and Lardeur; the discrete Kirchhoff–Mindlin elements DKMQ [45] and DKMT proposed by Katili [46]; the discrete-sheargap (DSG) method proposed by Bletzinger et al. [47]; etc. Also based on the ANS method, Tessler and Hughes [48] proposed a three-node Mindlin plate element (MIN3) in which a complete quadratic deﬂection ﬁeld is constrained by continuous shear edge constraints. The MIN3 is free of shear locking and produces convergent solutions. However, the accuracy of the MIN3 element is still worse than those of some others three-node plate elements [14], especially for the thick plate. In the other frontier of developing advanced ﬁnite element technologies, Liu and Nguyen-Thoi et al. [49] have applied a strain smoothing technique of meshfree methods [50] into the conventional ﬁnite element method (FEM) using linear interpolations to formulate a series of smoothed FEM (S-FEM) models named as the cell-based S-FEM (CS-FEM) [51–55], the node-based S-FEM (NS-FEM) [56–60], the edge-based S-FEM (ES-FEM) [61–66] and the face-based S-FEM (FSFEM) [67,68]. In these S-FEM models, the ﬁnite element mesh is used similarly as in the FEM models. However, these S-FEM models evaluate the weakform based on smoothing domains created from the entities of the element mesh such as cells/elements, or nodes, or edges, or faces. These smoothing domains can be located inside the elements (CS-FEM) or cover parts of adjacent elements (NS-FEM, ES-FEM and FS-FEM). These smoothing domains are linear independent and hence ensure stability and convergence of the S-FEM models. In the CS-FEM [51,52], the number of supporting nodes in smoothing domains are as same as those in elements, and hence the bandwidth of stiffness matrix in the CS-FEM is

similar to that in the FEM. However, due to using the strain smoothing technique to increase the accuracy in each elements, the computational cost in the CS-FEM is a little higher than those of the FEM. However, in general, when the efﬁciency of computation (computation time for the same accuracy) in terms of the error estimator versus computational cost is considered, the CS-FEM is still efﬁcient than the counterpart FEM models. The CS-FEM, however so far, has been developed mainly only for the 4-node quadrilateral elements [51–54] and the improvement of accuracy of solutions compared to those of FEM is still marginal. This paper hence extends the CS-FEM for triangular elements and for significant improvement of solutions of plate analysis. The cell-based strain smoothing technique in the CS-FEM is combined with the MIN3 [48] to give a so-called the cell-based smoothed MIN3 (CS-MIN3) for static and free vibration analyses of plates. In the process of formulating the system stiffness matrix of the CS-MIN3, each triangular element will be divided into three sub-triangles, and in each subtriangle, the stabilized MIN3 is used to compute the strains and to avoid the transverse shear locking. Then the strain smoothing technique on whole the triangular element is used to smooth the strains on these three sub-triangles.

2 Weakform for the Reissner–Mindlin plate Consider a plate under bending deformation. The middle (neutral) surface of plate is chosen as the reference plane that occupies a domain ⊂ R 2 as shown in Fig. 1. Let wbe the deﬂection, and β T = βx β y be the vector of rotations, in which βx , β y are the rotations of the middle plane around y- and x-axis, respectively, with the positive directions deﬁned as shown in Fig. 1. The unknown vector of three independent ﬁeld variables at any point in the problem domain of the Reissner–Mindlin plates can be written as u T = w βx β y (1)

The curvature of the deﬂected plate κ and the shear strains γ are deﬁned, respectively, as κ = Ld β γ = ∇w + β (2) (3)

where ∇ = [∂/∂ x ∂/∂ y]T , and Ld is a differential operator matrix deﬁned by ⎡ ⎤ ∂/∂ x 0 ∂/∂ y ⎦ (4) Ld = ⎣ 0 ∂/∂ y ∂/∂ x The standard Galerkin weakform of the static equilibrium equations for the Reissner–Mindlin plate can now be written as [69]:

4 CS-MIN3 formulation for the Reissner–Mindlin plate In this section, the cell-based strain smoothing technique [51] is combined with the MIN3 [48] to give a so-called the CS-MIN3 for static and free vibration analyses of plates.

4.1 Brief on the MIN3 formulation [48] In the MIN3 [48], the rotations are assumed to be linear through the rotational DOFs at three nodes of the elements, and the deﬂection is initial assumed to be quadratic through the deﬂection DOFs at six nodes (three node of the elements and three mid-edge points). Then, by enforcing continuous shear constraints at every element edge, the deﬂection DOFs at three mid-edge points can be removed and the deﬂection is now approximated only by vertex DOFs at three nodes of the elements. The MIN3 element hence can overcome shearlocking-free and produces convergent solutions [48]. In this paper, we just brief on the MIN3 formulation which is necessary for the formulation of the CS-MIN3. Using a mesh of three-node triangular elements as shown in Fig. 2, two rotations βx and β y at the element level are assumed to be linear as

where s denotes the edge coordinate and βn is the tangential edge rotation as shown in Fig. 2.

It was suggested [70] that a stabilization term needs to be added to further improve the accuracy of approximate solutions and to stabilize shear force oscillations. Such a modiﬁˆ cation is achieved by simply replacing Ds in Eq. (26) by Ds , as follows.

H I βx I In the CS-MIN3, each triangular element is divided into three sub-triangles by connecting the central point of the element to three ﬁeld nodes, and the displacement vector at the central point is assumed to be the average of three displacement vectors of ﬁeld nodes. In each sub-triangles, MIN3 is used to compute the strains, and then the strain smoothing technique on whole triangular element is used to smooth the strains on these three sub-triangles. Hence, the continuous shear constraints in CS-MIN3 will be satisﬁed at three element edges, and also at three interior lines connecting the central point with three ﬁeld nodes. The CS-MIN3 is hence softer than MIN3, and shows many superior properties compared to than the MIN3 and other triangular plate elements. Consider a typical triangular element e as shown in Fig. 4. We now divide the element into three sub-triangles 1 , 2 and 3 by connecting the central point O with three ﬁeld nodes as shown in Fig. 4. The coordinates x O = [x O y O ]T of the central point O are calculated by xO = (26) 1 (x1 + x2 + x3 ) ; 3 yO = 1 (y1 + y2 + y3 ) 3 (31)

Now, applying the cell-based strain smoothing operation in the CS-FEM [51,52], the bending strains κ 1 , κ 2 , κ 3 and shear strains γ 1 , γ 2 , γ 3 are, respectively, used to ˜ create a smoothed bending strain κe and a smoothed shear ˜ strain γe on the element e , such as: ˜ κe =

5 Numerical results In this section, various numerical examples are performed to show the accuracy and stability of the proposed CS-MIN3 compared to the analysis solutions. For comparison, several other elements such as DSG3 [47], ES-DSG3 [14], MIN3 [48] and MITC4 [35] have also been implemented in our package. 5.1 Static analysis The patch test is performed and CS-MIN3 element passes the patch test within machine precision.

Only three eigenvalues are always zero (corresponding to the rigid body modes of the element) for various element shapes of very thin and thick plates, and the CS-MIN3 element has no spurious zeroenergy modes as shown in various numerical examples in Sect. 5. Also note that the introduction of the central points in the triangular elements in the CS-MIN3 is only for the intermediate formulation of the element stiffness matrix. In the ﬁnal form of element stiffness matrix as shown in Eq. (45), the nodal displacement vectors of the central points will be replaced by those of three vertex nodes. Hence no extra DOF are associated with these central points. This means that the

5.1.1 Square plate Figure 5a and b describe the models of a square plate (length L, thickness t) with clamped (w = βn = βs = 0) and simply supported (w = βs = 0) boundary conditions subjected to a uniform load q = 1, respectively. The material parameters are given by Young’s modulus E = 1.092.000 and Poisson’s ratio ν = 0.3. Five uniform discretizations N × N of plate with N =4, 8, 10, 12 and 16 are used and a quarter of these discretizations are plotted in Fig. 5c. The detailed expressions of analytical solutions can be found by Taylor and Auricchio [42]. First, a shear locking test using a coarse mesh (mesh 12 × 12) for the clamped plate is performed and the central deﬂection and central moment are shown in Fig. 6. The results show that similarly to DSG3, MIN3, ES-DSG3

and MITC4, the CS-MIN3 also provides a locking-free solution when the plate thickness becomes progressively small.

For the clamped plate, the convergence of the central deﬂection and the central moment against the different mesh densities N × N for the thin plate (ratio t/L = 0.001) and thick plate (ratio t/L = 0.1) are plotted in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively. It is seen that with the same DOF, the CS-MIN3 is worse than the MITC4 but better than the DSG3 and MIN3 for both thin and thick plates. Compared to the ES-DSG3, the CS-MIN3 usually gives better results for thin plates, but a little worse results for thick plates. Figure 9 compares the computational time of methods for the clamped plate with t/L = 0.1. It is seen that with the same set of nodes, the CS-MIN3 takes a longer time to solve than the MIN3 and MITC4, but a little better than the ES-DSG3. For the simply supported plate (w = βs = 0), the convergence of the central deﬂection and the central moment against the different mesh densities N × N for the thin plate (ratio t/L = 0.001) and thick plate (ratio t/L = 0.1) are plotted in Figs. 10 and 11. It is again conﬁrmed the obtained comments as in the above clamped plate.

discretizations N × N of plate with N = 4, 8, 10, 12 and 16 are used and a quarter of these discretizations are plotted in Fig. 12b. The convergence of the deﬂection and principal moments at the central point by various methods are plotted in Figs. 13 and 14. It is seen that the CS-MIN3 shows remarkably excellent performance compared to the DSG3, MIN3 and even MITC4, and is a good competitor to the ES-DSG3. These results hence imply that for problems with skew geometries, the CS-MIN3 can give high accurate solutions and is a strong competitor to many existing plate elements.

5.2 Free vibration analysis of plates In this section, we investigate the accuracy and efﬁciency of the CS-MIN3 element for analyzing natural frequencies of plates. The plate may have free (F), simply (S) supported or clamped (C) edges. The symbol, CFSF, for instance, represents clamped, free, supported and free boundary conditions along the edges of rectangular plate. A non-dimensional frequency parameter is often used to stand for the frequencies and the obtained results use the regular meshes. The results of the CS-MIN3 are then compared to analytical solutions and other numerical results which are available in the literature.

5.1.2 Skew plate We now consider a rhombic plate with simply supported (w = 0) boundary conditions subjected to a uniform load q = 1 as shown in Fig. 12a. This plate was originally studied by Morley [72]. Geometry and material parameters are given by length L = 100, thickness t = 0.1, Young’s modulus E = 10.92 and Poisson’s ratio ν = 0.3. Five uniform

than the consistent mass matrix. For the displacement-based plate elements, the stiffness matrix K is usually stiffer than the real stiffness matrix. Using the lumped mass matrix instead of consistent mass matrix in the displacement-based plate elements will hence soften the over-stiffness of the system and will help to give much more accurate eigen frequency prediction. 5.2.1 Square plate We now consider square plates of length L and thickness t. The material parameters are Young’s modulus E = 2.0 × 1011 , Poisson’s ratio ν = 0.3 and the density mass ρ = 8, 000. A non-dimensional frequency parameter = (ω2 ρa 4 t/D)1/4 is used, where D = Et 3 /(12(1 − ν 2 )) is the ﬂexural rigidity of the plate. First, we analyze two thin and thick SSSS plates corresponding to thickness-to-length t/L = 0.005 and t/L = 0.1. The geometry of the plate is shown in Fig. 5b, and four uniform discretizations N × N of plate with N = 4, 8, 16, and 24 are used and a quarter of these discretizations are plotted in Fig. 5c. Figure 15 shows the affection of using of the lumped mass matrix and the consistent mass matrix by Eq. (17) to the ﬁrst frequency of the CS-MIN3. It is seen that the results of

Also note that, in dynamic analysis using the CS-MIN3, we can use the usual consistent mass matrix deﬁned in Eq. (17) to compute. However, in this paper for computational efﬁciency [69], the well-known lumped mass matrix is used. The reason is that the lumped mass matrix is usually softer

the CS-MIN3 using the lumped mass matrix are much more accurate than those of the CS-MIN3 using the consistent mass matrix, and even better than those of the MITC4 (using the consistent mass matrix). In this paper, we hence use the lumped mass matrix for the CS-MIN3 in all free vibration analyses with the aim of increasing the accuracy of solutions and computational efﬁciency. Tables 2 and 3 give the convergence of six lowest frequencies of thin plate (t/L = 0.005) and thick plate (t/L = 0.1),

respectively. In addition, Figs. 16 and 17 plot the values of six lowest frequencies of thin plate (t/L = 0.005) and thick plate (t/L = 0.1) for two uniform meshes 4 × 4 and 24 × 24, respectively. It is observed that the results of CS-MIN3 agree excellently with the analytical results [73] and are much more accurate than those of the others elements for both thin and thick plates, and for both coarse and ﬁne meshes. In particular, the CS-MIN3 can provide accurately the values of high frequencies of plates by using only coarse meshes.

Next, we analyze two thin and thick CCCC square plates shown in Fig. 5a. Four uniform meshes and two ratios of thickness-to-length t/L are similar to those of the SSSS plate case. Tables 4 and 5 give the convergence of six lowest frequencies of thin plate (t/L = 0.005) and thick plate (t/L = 0.1), respectively. In addition, Figs. 18 and 19 plot the values of six lowest frequencies of thin plate (t/L = 0.005) and thick plate (t/L = 0.1) for two uniform meshes 4×4 and 24×24, respectively. Again it is seen that the obtained

comments in the SSSS plates are conﬁrmed for the CCCC plates. 5.2.2 Skew plate We now consider the thin (t/L = 0.001) and thick (t/L = 0.2) cantilever rhombic (CFFF) plates. The geometry of the ◦ plate is illustrated in Fig. 20a with skew angle α = 60 . The

material parameters are Young’s modulus E = 2.0 × 1011 , Poisson’s ratio ν = 0.3 and the density mass ρ = 8, 000. A non-dimensional frequency parameter is used. Four uniform discretizations N × N of plate with N = 4, 8, 16 and 24 are used and a quarter of these discretizations are plotted in Fig. 20b. Figures 21 and 22 plot the values of six lowest frequencies of thin plate (t/L = 0.001) and thick plate (t/L = 0.2) for two uniform meshes 4 × 4 and 24 × 24, respectively. Again, it is conﬁrmed that the results of CSMIN3 agree excellently with those of the semi-analytical pb2 Ritz method [74], and are much more accurate than those

DSG3, MIN3 and MITC4 for both coarse and ﬁne meshes, and is a good competitor of the ES-DSG3. In particular, the CS-MIN3 can provide accurately the values of high frequencies of plates by using only coarse meshes.

the formulations and numerical examples, some concluding remarks can be drawn as follows: • The CS-MIN3 uses only three DOFs at each vertex node without additional DOF. The CS-MIN3 is free of shear locking and passes the patch test. • The CS-MIN3 only use the triangular elements which is a clear advantage compared to using four-node quadrilateral elements of MITC4. This advantage will be seen clearer when the geometry domain of plate is skew or complicated. • For static analysis, the results of the CS-MIN3 agree well with analytical solutions and results of several other published elements in the literature. The CS-MIN3 is much more accurate than DSG3, MIN3 and is a good competitor to ES-DSG3, MITC4 for some cases. • For free vibration analysis, the CS-MIN3 is stable temporally, agrees well with analytical solutions and shows some superior properties. The CS-MIN3 gives more accu-

rate results than the DSG3, MIN3, MITC4 and ES-DSG3 and shows to be a strong competitor to existing complicated quadrilateral plate elements such as the Rayleigh– Ritz method, the pb-2 Ritz method. In particular, the CS-MIN3 can provide accurately the values of high frequencies of plates by using only coarse meshes. • For the problems with skew geometries, the CS-MIN3 shows to be a strong competitor to others methods. Note that, the performance of CS-MIN3 is also simple and only based on elements, the CS-MIN3 hence can be extended to geometrical nonlinear problems easily by adding to a non-linear membrane strain and using the total Lagrangian approach and arc-length technique as performed in the [53]. Furthermore, CS-MIN3 can be extended easily to the ﬂat shell element in which each node will have 6 DOF, and a transformation matrix of coordinates needs to be used to transform the global coordinate system to the local coordinate system as performed in [75]. This extension hence highlights

the advantage of CS-MIN3 which uses only triangular elements, because the geometry of shell structures is often much more complicated than that of plate structures. In addition, the extension of CS-MIN3 for the implementation of material nonlinear behaviour in plate problems will be veriﬁed in coming time.
