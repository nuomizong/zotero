Abstract: A smoothed ﬁnite element method (SFEM) is presented to analyze linear and geometrically nonlinear problems of plates and shells using bilinear quadrilateral elements. The formulation is based on the ﬁrst order shear deformation theory. In the present SFEM, the elements are further divided into smoothing cells to perform strain smoothing operation, and the strain energy in each smoothing cell is expressed as an explicit form of the smoothed strain. The effect of the number of divisions of smoothing cells in elements is investigated in detail. It is found that using three smoothing cells for bending strain energy integration and one smoothing cell for shear strain energy integration achieve most accurate results and hence these numbers recommended for plates and shells in this study. In the geometrically nonlinear analysis, the total Lagrangian approach is adopted. The arc-length technique in conjunction with the modiﬁed Newton-Raphson method is utilized to solve the nonlinear equations. The numerical examples demonstrate that the present SFEM provides very stable and most accurate results with the similar computational effort compared to the existing FEM techniques tested in this work. Keyword: smoothed ﬁnite element method, plate and shell, mid-rectangle rule, nonlinear, smoothed weak form.

1 Introduction In the past decades, the ﬁnite element method (FEM) has been playing a very important role in solving various problems in engineering and science, including mechanics problems of plates and shells [Zienkiewicz and Taylor (2000); Liu and Quek (2003)]. A number of plate and shell elements have been developed for linear and nonlinear analysis. Batoz and Tahar (1982) proposed a discrete Kirchhoff quadrilateral element (DKQ), which can give efﬁcient results for bending problems for thin plates, but not for thick plates. Bathe and Dvorkin (1985) presented a 4-node plate element based on Mindlin-Reissner theory using mixed interpolated tensorial components (MITC). Belytschko and Leviathan (1994) developed a one point quadrature quadrilateral shell element with physical hourglass control. In recent years, meshfree methods have been developed and achieved remarkable progress for solving plate and shell problems, and many works are summarized in the book by Liu (2002), Atluri (2005). Chen and Liu (2001) had used the element free Galerkin (EFG) method for solving static and dynamic problem of thin plate of complicated shape. Composite laminated plates had also been studied for vibration problems, buckling problems [Chen et al. (2002, 2003)]. Shells had also been analyzed using EFG [Liu et al. (2002)]. Wang and Chen (2004) presented a Mindlin-Reissner plate formulation using a stabilized conforming nodal integration to mitigate the shear locking. A radial point interpolation method [Liu et al. (2008)] was formulated for plate problems using the smoothed nodal integration. Meshless Local Petrov-Galerkin (MLPG) Method [Atluri and Shen (2002); Atluri (2004)] was also employed for plates and shells analysis by many researchers [Gu and Liu (2001); Long

and Atluri (2002); Soric et al. (2004); Li et al. (2005); Sladek et al. (2006); Jarak et al. (2007)], and Atluri et al. (2004) proposed a meshless ﬁnite volume method through the MLPG “mixed” approach. For nonlinear analysis of plates and shells, Horrigmoe and Bergan (1978) presented a general formulation for geometrically nonlinear analysis of shells using ﬂat ﬁnite elements. Hughes and Liu (1981) presented a general nonlinear ﬁnite element formulation using uniform reduced integration for shell analysis. Recently, Lee et al. (2002) introduced a geometrically nonlinear assumed strain formulation of a nine-node solid shell element. Wen and Hon (2007) formulated a Reissner-Mindlin plate element for geometrically nonlinear analysis by using a meshless collocation method. The other works of plates and shells analysis include those given by Basar and Kintzell (2003), Qian et al. (2003), Suetake (2006). Although a signiﬁcant mount of works have been done using FEM, some inherent problems related to element distortion still remain unsolved. Liu et al. (2007a) proposed a smoothed ﬁnite element method (SFEM) by combining the standard FEM with the strain smoothing technique used in meshfree methods [Chen et al. (2005)]. The SFEM further divides the elements into smoothing cells and computes the integrals along the edges of the smoothing cells based on the Green’s divergence theorem. The n-sided polygonal element can be easily carried out using the SFEM [Dai et al. (2007)]. Liu et al. (2007b) gave detailed theoretical aspects including stability, bound property and convergence about the SFEM and revealed a number of attractive features resulted from the “softening” effects of the strain smoothing technique. Other problems solved using SFEM including free and forced vibration analysis [Dai and Liu (2007)], piezoelectric element analysis of two-dimensional smart structures [Nguyen-Van et al. (2008)]. A plate element [Nguyen-Xuan et al. (2008)] has been formulated using the SFEM. In Nguyen-Xuan’s work, only linear plate problem is considered and the formulation is the combination of SFEM and MITC, in which only the bending term is formulated by using SFEM, and shear

term is same as MITC element. In the present paper, the smoothed ﬁnite element method (SFEM) is further extended to linear and geometrically nonlinear analysis of plates and shells. In the present work, all terms of the element are formulated by using the SFEM, and we overcome the shear locking by using fewer smoothing cells in shear term than those in membrane and bending terms. The smoothed strains are computed directly only using shape functions, and the shape functions of arbitrary point in the quadrilateral element are created in a trivial, simple and explicit manner. Through an intensive numerical study, it is found that three smoothing cells for bending strain energy integration, and one cell for shear strain energy integration in an element produces the most accurate solutions that are much more accurate compared with the existing FEM techniques. 2 Basic formulation 2.1 Kinematics of shells In this section, the basic equations of shell theory are briefed. Based on the ﬁrst order shear deformation theory, the displacements u = [u, v, w] at a local coordinate system (x, y, z) are expressed as follows: u(x, y, z) = u0 (x, y) − zθx(x, y) v(x, y, z) = v0 (x, y) − zθy (x, y) w(x, y, z) = w0 (x, y) (1)

where u0 , v0 and w0 are the displacements of the mid-plane of the shell in the x, y and z directions, θx and θy denote the rotations about the y and x axes, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1. The strain vector ε can be written in terms of the mid-plane deformations using Eq. (1), which gives: ⎧ ⎫ ⎪εxx⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪εyy⎪ ⎨ ⎬ zε b 0 ε + ε = εxy = m + (2) 0 0 εs ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ εxz ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ ⎭ εyz where ε m is the membrane strain, ε b is the bending strain, and ε s is the shear strain.

where the subscript n is used to denote the load step number and the subscript j is used to represent the subsequent iteration cycle. The Arclength method presented by Crisﬁeld (1997) is used to overcome the ‘snap-throughs’ and the ‘snap-backs’. The convergence is checked using following criterion: g (d, λ ) <δ F (d, λ ) (51)

4 Numerical examples 4.1 Analysis of a square plate In order to test the efﬁciency of the present SFEM, a square plate of the length L and the thickness t subjected to different boundary conditions is considered in this section. The material properties are taken as Young’s modulus Eand Poisson ratio υ . Owing to the symmetry of the problem, only a quarter of the plate is modeled, as shown in Fig.4. 4.1.1 Effect of the number of smoothing cells A plate with L=10m and t=0.1m simply supported at all sides subjected to a transverse uniform load is investigated to study the effect of the number of smoothing cells used in the elements. The material properties are taken as Young’s modulus E = 3.0e7N/m2, Poisson ratio υ =0.3. This problem is analyzed using different number of elements and smoothing cells as shown in Fig.5. In order to mitigate the shear locking effect, only one smoothing cell is used on the shear strain term, and six different divisions, SC=1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 16, are used on the other terms. This technique to suppress the shear locking is the same as the reduced and selective integration techniques in FEM. For a comparison, the FEM quadrilateral element with reduced integration (Q4-R) proposed by Malkus and Hughes (1978) is also used in the analysis. The analytic solutions are given by Reismann (1988). Table 1 shows the numerical results of central deﬂection and Fig. 6 shows the relative error between numerical results and analytical solutions of the problem using SFEM with different divisions of smoothing cells. From the result, it is seen that when the number of smoothing cells is one or two, numerical results are bigger than analytical solutions, and when the number of smoothing cells is three or more, the numerical results are smaller than analytical solutions. The more the smoothing cells, the smaller results obtained. Regardless of the numbers of the smoothing cells used, the SFEM is more accurate than the FEM quadrilateral element with reduced integration (Q4-R) for this problem. These ﬁndings conﬁrm the properties of SFEM introduced Figure 4: A quarter of a square plate is meshed with quadrilateral elements.

by Liu et al. (2007b). There should be an optimal certain number of cells that can produce the most accurate result, and it is should be between 2∼4 for bilinear quadrilateral elements. Form the results of this problem, we ﬁnd that SFEM with SC=3&1, meaning that three cells for bending and membrane terms and one for shearing term, gives the best results. Therefore, SFEM (SC=3&1) is used in plates and shells problems in the following section. 4.1.2 Shear locking Shear locking results from the spurious appearance of transverse shear, which is generated due to the inability of the formulation based on the ﬁrst order deformation theory in reproducing pure bending mode. In this work, we use only one smoothing cell in computing shear strain matrix for avoiding shear locking which is similar to one point quadrature used in the FEM. To study the effectiveness of the present SFEM, a simply supported uniformly loaded square plate is used in the examination. For comparison, several existing FEM elements are also used in solving the same problem, including the mixed interpolated tensorial components element MITC4 [Bathe and Dvorkin (1985)], the reduced integration quadrilateral element Q4-R [Malkus and Hughes (1978)] and the discrete Kirchhoff quadrilateral element DKQ [Batoz and Tahar (1982)]. The results obtained using different methods are presented in Table 2 and Fig. 7 in terms of data and curves, respectively. It is clearly shown that

the SFEM can give the most accurate solution for the full range of length/thickness ratio of the plate. It works for both thick and thin plates without shear lockings, even for extremely thin plate of length/thickness ratio L/t = 107 .The DKQ was designed particularly for solving shear locking problems, and it indeed works well for thin plates. However, it gives wrong results for thick plates. MITC4 and Q4-R work well for thick plates, but the solution accuracy for the thin plates are much lower than SFEM (SC=3&1).

Table 3 and Table 4 report the normalized central deﬂections of the thin plate and the thick plate. It is seen that the present SFEM has high accuracy at coarse meshes and fast convergence regardless of the thickness of the plate. DKQ works well for thin plates nevertheless it gives wrong results for thick plates.

where w0 is the central deﬂection and D is the bending stiffness given as D = Et 3 /12 1 − ν 2 . A quarter of the plate is modeled due to the symmetry. The numerical solutions are obtained using four meshes of 2×2, 4×4, 6×6, 8×8. The nondimensional central deﬂection w0 /t is computed using the presented SFEM and listed in Table 6. Fig. 10 shows the load-displacement curves of numerical results computed from present method with different mesh density and analytic solutions calculated using Eq. (52). It is observed that the results converge very quickly to the analytic solution. When the mesh density is 8×8, the numerical results curve is very closed to analytic solutions curve. 4.2 Analysis of circular plate Linear and nonlinear analysis of a clamped circular plate subjected to uniform load is further studied in this section. The conﬁguration and mesh are shown in Fig. 11; the radius of the plate is R=5m and the thickness is t=0.1m. Poisson’s ratio of the material is taken to be 0.3, Young’s modulus of the material is 3e7N/m2 .

The analytic solutions are given by Reismann (1988). The relative errors of the central deﬂection between numerical results and analytical solutions are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. It can be seen that for both boundary conditions, the solution of the present SFEM is more accurate than that of the FEM Q4-R element. The SFEM model is less stiff than that of FEM of Q4-R element, which conﬁrms the properties of SFEM discussed in subsection 4.1.1. 4.1.5 Nonlinear analysis In this subsection, a clamped square plate under uniformly distributed load q is ana-

4.3 Scordelis-Lo roof problem The Scordelis-Lo roof shown in Fig. 14 is a famous benchmark problem for shell analysis to test a numerical method. The length of the shell is L=25ft, the radius is R=25ft, the thickness is t=0.25ft and the span angle is θ0 =40◦ . The material properties are: Poisson’s ratio υ =0.3, and Young’s modulus E=4.32e8N/ft2 . The boundary conditions at each end are supported by a rigid diaphragm. The loading is uniform vertical gravity load of q0 =90N/ft2. Owing to the symmetry, only a quarter of the roof is modeled. Several existing shell elements are used here to compare with the present method. They are 4Node SRI (A standard 4-node Mindlin element with selective reduced integration) proposed by Hughes and Liu (1981), YASE (A 4-node shell

element using one integration point and physical hourglass control) advanced by Engelmann and Whirley (1990), MITC4 (A 4-node fully integrated shell element using Mixed Interpolated Tensorial Components) proposed by Dvorkin and Bathe (1984), QPH (One point quadrature quadrilateral shell element with physical hourglass control) proposed by Belytschko and Leviathan (1994). The theoretical value 0.3024 of the vertical deﬂection at the centre of the free edge and the results of existing elements are obtained from Belytschko and Leviathan (1994). Table 7 shows the comparisons of the present result with solutions obtained by existing shell elements. It is observed that the present SFEM (SC=3&1) works very well. 4.4 Nonlinear analysis of shells A cylindrical shell panel clamped along all four boundaries shown in Fig. 14 is now investigated for nonlinear analysis. The shell panel is subjected to uniform inward radial loading q0 . This example has been studied extensively by a number of researchers using the ﬁnite element methods. The geometry parameters of the panel are: L=254mm, R=2540mm, t=3.175mm and θ0 =0.1rad. The material properties are: υ =0.3 and E=3.10275kN/mm2. Due to double symmetry of geometry and deformations, only onequarter of the panel was discretized using a mesh of 8×8. The present results of the center deﬂection, to-

gether with solutions given by Horrigmoe and Bergan (1978), Dhatt (1970) and Sabir and Lock (1973), are shown in Fig. 15. It is seen that the solutions agree well. The result using present SFEM (SC=3&1) is slightly bigger than others. It is conﬁrmed that the stiffness of the SFEM model is softer than that of the FEM. 4.5 Reinforcing Plate of Automobile’s Front Longeron Finally, an actual structure component of a Reinforcing Plate of Automobile’s Front Longeron with two ﬁxed ends shown in Fig.16 is studied here using the present SFEM.The length isL=271mm, the length of the ﬂanging is h=15mm, the width D=55.48mm, the radius of hole is R=15mm and the thickness is t=1mm. Poisson’s ratio of the material is taken to be 0.3; Young’s modulus of the material is E=2.1e5N/mm2 . The loading is uniform pressures on the surface which is q0 =0.01N/mm2 . Due to the symmetry, only half of the model is investigated with symmetry conditions applied on the nodes on the plane of symmetry. We study this problem using the present SFEM

(SC=3&1), and the FEM of quadrilateral element with reduced integration (Q4-R). The results of deﬂections along the line OA are plotted in Fig.17. The reference solutions are obtained using software Altair OptiStruct with large number of (22017) nodes. Fig.17 shows that the results using present method with 205 nodes is more close to the reference solutions.

SFEM for Linear and Geometrically Nonlinear Analysis of Plates and Shells

5 Conclusions A novel Smoothed Finite Element Method (SFEM) using quadrilateral elements is presented in this paper to analyze linear and geometrically nonlinear problems of plates and shells. The effect of the number of smoothing cells in an element is investigated in detail. It is found that three smoothing cells for bending strain energy integration, and one cell for shear strain energy integration is the most preferred for analysis of plates and shells. The numerical examples reveal the following features of the present method: (1) It uses strain smoothing technique that reduces the over-stiff phenomenon in the fully compatible displacement-based ﬁnite element. (2) Area integration over each smoothing cells is recast into line integration along its edges, and hence no mapping is needed. This allows the use of extremely distorted elements. (3) Shear locking phenomenon can be easily avoided by using only one smoothing cell for shear strain energy integration, and hence it works very well for both thick and thin plates and shells. (4) Numerical results obtained from the SFEM are more accurate and the convergence is faster compare with the existing FEM elements. (5) It works well for both linear and nonlinear problems.
