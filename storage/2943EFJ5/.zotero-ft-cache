The paper presents ï¬nite element free vibration and buckling analysis of laminated hat-stiffened shallow and deep shells using arbitrarily oriented stiffener formulation. Modiï¬ed approach for modelling the curved stiffener is implemented using necessary transformations. A simpliï¬ed stiffener formulation is presented to accommodate various shapes of stiffener shapes in developing the rigidity matrix for the ï¬nite element formulation. Investigation has been carried out on free vibration and buckling analyses of laminated composite stiffened shell structures with laminated open section (rectangular or âTâ shaped) and closed section (âhatâ shaped) stiffeners. Parametric study on the hatstiffened panels for the free vibration and buckling analyses conï¬rms that the closed section stiffener being torsionally rigid is found to show better performance over open section stiffeners. & 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

1. Introduction Stiffened plates/shells are widely used as structural components in various ï¬elds of engineering. High-performance composite materials are in extensive use due to their inherent high stiffness and strength to weight ratio. Composite stiffened plates and shells are very widely used in aircraft and ship structures to achieve weight saving. Hat shaped stiffeners being torsionally rigid can enhance the strength of a plate/shell structure to a greater extent than open section stiffeners such as rectangular or âTâ section stiffeners. Very often the structures are subjected to both static and dynamic loads of various magnitudes and complexities. To investigate the actual behaviour of the structures under these loads, rigorous analysis is required to assess the strength and stability under various boundary conditions and loading cases. The ï¬nite element method has emerged as the most powerful numerical tool because of its generality and capability to handle structural and geometrical complexities with ease. In view of this, several commercial software packages have been developed for carrying out structural analyses. However, the commercial software packages suffer from inefï¬cient stiffener modelling which demands that the mesh lines should coincide with the stiffeners. This requirement complicates the analysis of stiffened structures having unequally spaced, arbitrarily oriented stiffeners within the

structure. The present investigation is carried out with a generalised ï¬nite element formulation of the author [30] on laminated composite stiffened structures which can take care of arbitrarily oriented stiffeners of diverse conï¬gurations. This paper presents an investigation on free vibration and buckling analyses of laminated composite stiffened shell structures with laminated open section (rectangular or âTâ shaped) and closed section (âhatâ shaped) stiffeners in particular. Depending upon the behaviour under torsion, the stiffener can be classiï¬ed into two categories i.e. open and closed sections. The open section such as the âIâ, inverted âTâ, âZâ, âJâ and rectangular sections are torsionally ï¬exible as against the closed section in the form of hat and box sections. In metallic and FRP construction of aircrafts and ships, the curved section stiffeners have so far been disposed in various ways within the structure. The positioning of the stiffeners with respect to the shell midsurface, i.e. eccentric or concentric is also a matter of concern to the structural analyst. When the stiffener centroid is coincident with the plate/shell midsurface, it is called concentric stiffener, whereas the stiffener centroid and plate/shell midsurface is eccentric, it is called eccentric stiffener. In the present work, emphasis is given in the use of eccentric/concentric, open/closed section laminated stiffeners in laminated shell structures under various loading and boundary conditions. In the present work, a ï¬nite element free vibration and buckling analyses has been carried out of laminated stiffened shells with open and closed section stiffeners following the arbitrary oriented stiffener approach.

association with a three-noded curved beam element for the stiffeners has been used in the formulation of laminated stiffened shell analysis. First-order shear deformation theory based on the ReissnerâMindlin theory has been used to take care of the transverse shear deformation. The shell element formulation presented here can be considered as an advance over the degenerated shell concept. The formulation can take care of analysing shallow to deep and thin to thick laminated shells. The stiffener is considered to be a line element whose rigidity has been placed along its centroidal axis. A generalised formulation for the development of the rigidity matrix of open and closed section stiffeners has been presented. Necessary transformations have been incorporated to take care of arbitrarily oriented stiffeners anywhere within the shell element.

2. Literature review Bhimaraddi et al. [1,2] have presented the ï¬nite element analysis of laminated shells of revolution with laminated stiffeners. In their study, they have used 12-noded isoparametric shell element having 64 degrees of freedom in association with fournoded curved beam having 24 degrees of freedom at each node. The analyses suffer from the limitations that the stiffeners have to Ë Â¨ be placed along the nodal lines only. Mecitoglu and Dokmeci [3] have analysed the free vibration of a stiffened shallow shell numerically by the collocation method within the framework of the theory of classical thin orthotropic shallow shells. The eccentricity of stiffeners is included in the analysis by providing the moments of inertia of the stiffeners. The vibration characteristics of unidirectional and orthogonally stiffened shallow shells have been studied for various geometrical and material parameters. A parametric study of the vibration characteristics of unidirectional and orthogonally stiffened shallow shells has been carried out for various geometrical and material parameters. Sivadas and Ganeshan [4] have analysed combined shells, cylinder-cone cylinder-plate and stiffened shells for their free vibration characteristics using a higher-order semi-analytical ï¬nite element using elements with three nodes and 21 degrees of freedom. Their analysis is based on the shell theory discussed by Kraus [5]. The free vibration characteristics of combined shells and the effect of circumferential stiffeners on frequency has been studied in their analysis. A parametric study on shells with various conï¬gurations, material and geometric properties has been carried out. Bert et al. [6] have presented an analytical solution for thin-walled circular cylindrical shells constructed from composite materials and provided with ring or stringer stiffeners. They have made an attempt to evaluate the accuracy of various approximate theories by the use of dimensionless tracer coefï¬cients and assessing the relative improvement in the lowest natural frequency due to the use of ring stiffeners instead of stringer stiffeners. Their study concludes that for a reasonably wide range of geometric parameters, all ï¬ve theories are in reasonably good agreement. Sinha and Mukhopadhyay [7] have investigated the free vibration of isotropic stiffened shells using a stiffened shallow shell ï¬nite element. A high precision curved triangular shallow shell of

Cowper et al. [8] has been used to model the shell. Their formulation takes care of the arbitrary orientation of stiffeners, which need not necessarily lie in the direction of the principal curvature of the shell. The element matrices for the stiffened shell element have been generated from the contributions of the shell and the stiffener separately. Examples from the published literature have been solved for the validation of the stiffened shallow shell element. The element suffers from the limitation that it cannot analyse deep shell structures. Liew et al. [9] have presented a survey on the vibration of shell panels which covers a large amount of literature on the subject. Lim and Liew [10] and Liew and Lim [11,12] have presented the p-Ritz method for predicting the vibratory behaviour of shallow cylindrical and doubly curved panels. The method is of an analytic type where the entire domain is represented by admissible functions considering the boundary conditions. Lee and Kim [13] have presented analytical solutions for the free vibrations of the rotating composite cylindrical shells with orthogonal stiffeners using the energy method. Loveâs shell theory based on the discrete stiffener theory has been used to derive the governing equation of the rotating composite cylindrical shell with orthogonal stiffeners. The stiffeners have been assumed to be an integral part of the shell and have been directly included in their analysis. The effect on the natural frequencies due to the parameters such as the stiffener height-to-width ratio, the shell thickness, and the shell length-to-radius ratio has been studied in their investigation. Wang and Lin [14] presented a theoretical investigation of stability characteristics of axially compressed simply-supported thin cylindrical shells stiffened by longitudinal stiffeners. Numerical results for cylindrical shells reinforced by only a few longitudinal stiffeners were obtained for the buckling analysis and to describe the buckling modes. Agarwal and Davis [15] have investigated optimum hat-stiffened compression panel designs using structural synthesis technique. The study show a 50% weight savings is possible in using graphiteâepoxy panels over optimised aluminium panels apart from the fact that the composite panels are shown to process a variety of proportions at nearly constant weight. William and Steins [16], Funatogawa et al. [17] and Wang and Dawe [18] have made studies on the hatstiffened plates. Ray [19] has carried out the buckling analysis of laminated hat-stiffened plates using ï¬nite element method. Sheinman and Simitses [20] have presented a methodology for the buckling analysis of imperfect, thin, circular cylindrical and isotropic stiffened shells under uniform axial compression. The methodology is based on the smeared technique and the von KarmanâDonnell nonlinear kinematic relation in the presence of geometric imperfections. They have demonstrated few examples to draw general conclusions regarding the imperfection sensitivity of stiffened cylinders under axial compression and for various end conditions. Jun and Hong [21] have presented the formulation of the geometrically nonlinear ï¬nite element procedure based on an updated Lagrangian description. Cylindrical panels with the general symmetric laminate [0/7y/90]s under axial compression are considered and a parametric study is performed in order to investigate the effect of the change of panel width and ï¬bre angles on the buckling stress. The buckling stress was found to vary as

a result of the change of panel width. A general conclusion for the designers regarding the selection of ï¬bre angles in a laminate has been addressed. Ding and Xu [22] have presented a numerical method of analysing the elastic stability of thin and longitudinally stiffened laminated shells of revolution. The discrete stiffener approach has been followed in their formulation. The formulation cannot model for stiffeners having different shapes and lamination schemes. Further, the authors have mentioned that the formulation needs more memory space. An analytical tool for buckling and vibration analysis of laminated shallow curved panels was presented by Sheinman and Reichman [23]. The HuâWashizu mixed formulation for the potential energy was used in the analyses of an arbitrary curved laminated panel. Reddy and Stranes [24] have presented analytical solutions for buckling loads of composite cylindrical shells with axial and circumferential stiffeners using a layer wise shell theory. The layer wise shell theory accounts for displacement variations through the thickness of the shell. The orthotropic theory has been followed to consider the effect of stiffeners on the shell, i.e. the individual stiffeners are averaged out over representative areas with a consideration for the eccentricity of stiffeners. Tian et al. [25] presented the Ritz method for the elastic buckling analysis of shells with ring stiffeners under general pressure loading. The stiffeners may be of any cross-sectional shape and arbitrarily distributed along the shell length. The buckling solution for shells with various end conditions, stiffener distribution and under various pressure distributions were presented in a non-dimensionalised form. The study is limited to isotropic, thin and perfectly circular cylindrical shell only. Based on the critical review, it can be revealed that none of the formulations cannot accommodate arbitrarily oriented stiffeners located anywhere within the shell element.

Eqs. (4) and (5) represent standard eigen value problem and these have been solved using the simultaneous iteration technique to extract the eigen values and the eigen vectors. In these equations 1/o2 and 1/l are the eigen values. Thus, the eigen values corresponding to the lowest natural frequencies and the buckling loads are obtained using the simultaneous iteration technique.

3. Finite element formulation and analysis A ï¬nite element formulation based on the ï¬rst-order shear deformation theory for stiffened shells is presented using quadratic isoparametric element, which has elegance in accommodating irregular boundaries; laminated materials by taking care of shear deformations and can be applied to thin/thick and shallow/deep shells. The stiffener is modelled as a three-noded curved beam element having same displacement function that of the shell element. The formulation takes care of stiffeners located within the structure in arbitrary manner. The complication due to the earlier concept of replacing the stiffeners with a plate/shell of orthotropic properties or by aligning the mesh lines along the stiffeners is avoided using the present approach with the use of suitable transformations to transfer the displacements from stiffener element nodes to that of the shell element nodes. The characteristic equations for a discretised elastic structural system undergoing small displacements having the material properties within the elastic range for the free vibration analysis can be expressed as Â½KÂfdg Ã o2 Â½MÂfdg Â¼ 0. For the buckling analysis, the expression is given by Â½KÂfdg Ã lÂ½K G Âfdg Â¼ 0, (2) (1)

The ï¬nite element formulation for the shell and stiffener with arbitrarily oriented stiffener has been discussed in detail by the author [30]. The formulation for the hat shaped stiffener has been made separately to incorporate into the FE formulation. In the ï¬nite element formulation the rigidity matrix of the hat shaped stiffener is treated considering its geometry into different segments. 3.1. Rigidity matrix of a hat stiffener The rigidity matrix of the hat stiffener has been developed as a sum of three segments of the stiffener (Fig. 1) for the analysis. The present formulation for the closed section (hat) stiffener has the capability to model for the open section stiffeners such as I, T and rectangular shaped stiffeners using the same rigidity matrix by suitable changes in the input for the stiffener geometry. The stressâstrain relation for the segment 1 w.r.t. stiffener axis system is written as 8 9 2 38 9 0 > â¬1 > Q 11 Q 16 > s1 > < = < = 6Q 0 7 â¬6 . s6 Â¼ 4 16 Q 66 (6) 5 > > > > :s ; 0 0 Q 44 : â¬4 ; 4 Similarly, the stressâstrain relation for the inclined portion of hat section (segment 2 and 3) is developed by resolving the stress components as

The above properties are transformed to the plate mid-plane using parallel axes theorem.

Based on the proposed formulation, a computer program has been generated to conduct the buckling analysis of laminated hatstiffened shells. Buckling analysis of composite stiffened shells is carried out using the simultaneous iteration technique [26]. Validation of the present formulation has been conï¬rmed by solving several benchmark examples from the published literature. Subsequently, parametric study is carried out to explain the free vibration and buckling behaviour of laminated hat-stiffened shells.

4. Parametric study 4.1. Parametric study on free vibration analysis Published literature on the free vibration analysis of laminated composite shells either with open (rectangular or âTâ shaped) or closed (âhatâ shaped) section stiffeners is not available. Hence, a parametric study has been carried out to present some new results. A cross-stiffened doubly curved laminated composite shell (Fig. 3) has been considered for the free vibration analysis. The material and the geometric properties are also shown in the ï¬gure. The simply supported boundary conditions at all the edges and the thickness ratio (a/h) for the shell equal to 50 has been taken. Closed (âhatâ shaped) and open (rectangular or âTâ) section stiffener shapes of equal area have been used as shown in Fig. 3(b). Tables 1

and 2 present the effect of curvature ratio (R/a) and ï¬bre orientation angle on the fundamental frequency of simply supported antisymmetric cross-ply and angle-ply laminated (two and four layers) doubly curved shells. It is observed from the investigation carried out that the fundamental frequency is very much dependent on the stiffener shapes apart from the curvature ratio (R/a) and ï¬bre orientation angle. The frequency increases with the increase in curvature ratio (R/a), i.e. from a shallow to a deep shell. In all the cases studied here, the closed section (âhatâ shaped) stiffener yields a higher frequency then the open section (rectangular and âTâ shaped) stiffeners. It is also observed in Tables 1 and 2 that for the antisymmetric angle-ply lamination scheme with two or four layers for the shell and the stiffener, the frequency increases up to a ply angle of 451 and then decreases when the ply angle is increased further. The hat-stiffened shell is thus a stiffer structure and the stiffest lamination scheme is that with a ply angle of 451. Table 3 shows the effect of thickness ratio (a/h) and curvature ratio (R/a) on the frequency of a simply supported, antisymmetric cross-ply laminated doubly curved stiffened shell. The lamination scheme in the shell and the stiffener is kept constant, i.e. [0/90]2. Investigations have been carried out for thickness ratios a/h Â¼ 200, 100, 50 and 10, i.e. for stiffened shells of varying thickness, and for various curvature ratios R/a Â¼ 5, 10, 100 and 1030, i.e. from a deep shell to a ï¬at plate. The free vibration analysis is carried out for the laminated shell with open and closed section stiffeners, keeping the stiffener area constant in all cases. As expected, it is observed that for a particular thickness ratio the hat-stiffened shell with the smallest curvature ratio yields the highest frequency. Table 4 presents the effect of the boundary condition along the edges, lamination sequence and the curvature ratio on an antisymmetric laminated doubly curved stiffened shell with open and closed section stiffeners. Possible combinations of boundary conditions at the edges have been considered. Four layer antisymmetric lamination schemes such as [0/90]2, [45/Ã45]2 and [75/Ã75]2 for the shell and [0/90]2 for the stiffener have been considered while keeping the thickness ratio (a/h) equal to 50. It is observed that the frequencies are higher for all edges clamped boundary condition with ï¬bre orientation angle

4.2. Parametric study on buckling analysis A parametric study has been carried out for a centrally stiffened laminated cylindrical shell to present results on the topic using the proposed ï¬nite element approach. The laminated unstiffened panel was initially chosen by Di Sciuva and Carerra [29] for buckling analysis. In this parametric study, the panel is stiffened with a central (rectangular or âTâ shaped) or closed (âhatâ shaped) section laminated stiffener. The geometric and the lamina material properties of the structure are shown in Fig. 4. Three different kinds of loading cases chosen for the analyses are 1. Axial compression along stiffener direction only. 2. In-plane shear. 3. Biaxial compression and in-plane shear. In order to observe the effect of the stiffener shape on the buckling capacity of the stiffened shell, the cross-sectional area of the stiffener has been kept constant while deciding the geometrical details of the stiffener shape. All the edges of the stiffened shell are considered to be the simply supported boundary condition. In the present investigation, the variations in the 3 buckling load parameter Ã°l Â¼ N cr a2 =ET h Ã due to changes in geometrical parameters such as curvature ratio (R/a), thickness ratio (a/h) and the number of layers in a centrally stiffened laminated composite shell have been studied.

shell is discussed in this section. The laminated stiffened cylindrical shell shown in Fig. 4 for constant span (a Â¼ 100), investigations have been carried out for thickness ratios Â¼ 20, 30 and 40. The stacking sequence in the shell and the stiffener is considered to be the same, i.e. [0/90/0/90/0]T. The curvature ratio (R/a) has been taken as 20. Table 5 presents the buckling load 3 parameter Ã°l Â¼ Ncr a2 =ET h Ã for the stiffened cylindrical shell with various thickness ratios (a/h) and stiffener shapes. It is observed that the thickness ratio (a/h) has an important effect on the buckling capacity of the stiffened shell. For the assumed value of curvature parameter, there is a monotonic increase in the buckling factor with increasing a/h ratio. The buckling parameter is higher for the hat-stiffened shell as compared to the rectangular and âTâ-stiffened shells keeping the stiffener cross sectional area constant. The convergence study presented in Table 5 has been carried out with different mesh sizes to establish the accuracy of the proposed ï¬nite element approach. A rapid monotonic convergence of the results with the increase in mesh size has been observed in all cases.

4.2.2. Effect of number of layers on the buckling parameter The effect of number of layers on the buckling characteristics of a cross-ply or angle-ply laminated cylindrical shell with a centrally placed laminated stringer stiffener of different shapes is discussed in this section. In the present investigation two and four

layered antisymmetric laminate having cross-ply and angle-ply lamination sequence has been considered. The stiffened shell has a simply supported boundary condition at all the edges. Three possible loading cases have been considered. The stacking sequences in the shell and the stiffener have been taken to be same. Closed (âhatâ shaped) and open (rectangular and âTâ shaped) section stiffeners have also been considered in the analysis. The thickness ratio (a/h) of the shell has been taken as 1/100. The ï¬nite element buckling analysis has been carried out with an 8 Ã 8 mesh size for the full structure. Table 6 shows the variation of 3 buckling parameter Ã°l Â¼ N cr a2 =Ã°ET h Ã for the laminated stiffened cylindrical shell with various antisymmetric lamination schemes and stiffener shapes for various loading cases. It is observed that with the increase in the number of layers (keeping the total laminate thickness same) for the cross-ply and angle-ply lamination scheme, the buckling parameter increases for all the loading cases. With the increase in number of layers from two to four in the laminate while keeping the thickness of the laminate same, will result a dramatic increase in buckling parameter as evidenced in the study presented in Table 6. This is evident due to the only change in Bij coupling terms which relate the in-plane forces to curvatures and moments to in-plane strains while keeping the Aij, in-plane stiffness and Dij, bending stiffness terms constant for the laminate of same thickness. This increase in buckling parameter will be slowed down if further increase in number of layers is made. The buckling parameter is marginally higher for the

hat-stiffened shell as compared to the stiffened shell with open section stiffeners due to the higher torsional rigidity of the âhatâ shaped stiffener. 4.2.3. Effect of curvature ratio (R/a) on the buckling parameter The effect of curvature ratio (R/a) on the buckling capacity of a laminated stiffened cylindrical shell is considered here. The parameters in previous case have been considered along with the change in curvature ratio to calculate the buckling para3 meterÃ°l Â¼ Ncr a2 =ET h Ã. Table 6 also presents the buckling parameters of an antisymmetric laminated stiffened shell for different curvature ratios. It is observed in this study that with the increase in curvature ratio (R/a), i.e. from deep to shallow shell, the buckling parameter reduces monotonically. It is also observed that the hat-stiffened shell shows a better performance than a shell with open stiffener.

5. Conclusion The free vibration and buckling analyses using the proposed ï¬nite element formulation presented for the laminated stiffened shells is well equipped to model and analyse arbitrarily oriented laminated stiffened plates and shells elegantly. The stiffener as a curved beam having different shape, size and lamination scheme can be oriented anywhere within the shell element. This is a distinct improvement over the existing ï¬nite element models for stiffened shell analysis. Free vibration and buckling analyses of composite stiffened shells highlighting the performance of closed section stiffener over the open section stiffener subjected to various kinds of loading, boundary condition, curvature ratio, lamination schemes etc. have been presented. Extensive investigation highlighting the performance of closed section stiffener over the open section stiffener subjected to various kinds of loading, boundary condition, curvature ratio, lamination schemes, etc. have been presented in the form of a parametric study which may be useful for the future investigators. Considering equal cross sectional area of stiffeners, the closed section stiffener (âhatâ shaped) being torsionally rigid is found to show better performance over open section stiffeners (rectangular and âTâ shaped) in all types of analyses carried out in this investigation. With a decrease in curvature ratio (R/a), i.e. from a ï¬at plate to deep shell, the performance of the hat-stiffener over the open section (rectangular and âTâ shaped) stiffeners diminishes.
