This paper presents a new simple four-node quadrilateral shell element with 24-dof which can be used to analyze thick and thin shell problems. This element which is developed from DKMQ plate element using the Naghdi/Mindlin/Reissner shell theory can take into account warping effects and coupling bending-membrane energy. This element, called DKMQ24, passed patch tests for membrane, bending and shear problems. It has also successfully passed benchmark tests in the case of thick and thin shells without shear locking. Moreover, the numerical results obtained with DKMQ24 converge toward the reference solution. & 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Researches on the ï¬nite element method are still being conducted, speciï¬cally to obtain better elements. The formulation of a simple and efï¬cient shell element which has a good accuracy in numerical analysis is highly desirable. Furthermore, the development of low-order shell ï¬nite elements is very interesting, because it enables to reduce in an important way the associated numerical costs especially for large scale non-linear analysis. A compromise between cost and accuracy must be found. Generally, the developments of shell element are based on 3-nodal (triangular) and 4-nodal (quadrilateral) elements. The associated formulations allow to take into account a wide variety of thicknesses, irregular geometry, different boundary conditions and rough discretization. MITC elements [1,2] are commonly used in engineering analysis and revealed to be effective in membrane-dominated and bendingdominated shell problems [3,4]. Briassoulis [5] has introduced an analytical approach to study the asymptotic behavior of shell elements. The asymptotic behavior of ï¬nite shell elements in membrane-dominated, bendingdominated and mixed membrane-bending shell problems were

evaluated using the explicit expressions for the characteristic asymptotic displacement. By using the Assumed Natural Strains (ANS) and Discrete Shear method to deï¬ne the shear strains, the development of three nodes DKT [6] and four nodes DKQ [7] elements for thick plate bending has been proposed by Batoz and Lardeur [8,9]. These two elements rely on plate equilibrium equations including shear (ReissnerâMindlin model). The ï¬rst one, called Discrete Shear Triangular (DST) has 9 d.o. f and the second one, called Discrete Shear Quadrilateral (DSQ), has 12 d.o.f. DST and DSQ elements converge towards to DKT and DKQ plate elements for thin plate problems. A modiï¬ed DST element, called DST-BK element, based on the formulation proposed by Bergan and Nygard [10], has been proposed by Batoz and Katili [11]. This element is free of shear locking and the numerical results obtained converge towards the reference solutions for all benchmark tests. Katili [12,13] has introduced DKMT and DKMQ element to analyze thick and thin plate problems. These elements are based on ReissnerâMindlin [14,15] hypothesis which require only C0 continuity. In the case of thin plate problem, the solution obtained with DKMT element converges to DKT [6] element, while the solution obtained with DKMQ element converges to DKQ [7] element. DKMT and DKMQ elements revealed to be free of shear locking and passed the classical patch tests associated. The problem of shear locking, when the thickness of the plate decreases, is resolved using the Discrete Kirchhoff Mindlin method proposed by Katili [12,13]. The capability of DKMQ and DKMT

plate element has been tested in [12,13] for thin and thick plate problems. The adaptation of DKMT and DKMQ elements to hybrid-mixed formulations has been introduced by Thermanto [16] and Ayad et al. [17,18]. This hybrid-mixed formulation is free of shear locking and passed all patch test from thick to thin plate analysis. Ayad et al. [19] has extended the formulation of DKMT element to laminated composite plate structures. Another ANS method, called DRM, based on the additional degrees of freedom on the middle edges, has been proposed by Onate et al. [20,21]. Although the triangular DRM element uses additional degrees of freedom in each sides of the element, the results are similar as those obtained with DMT element [22]. The formulation of DKMT plate element with facet shell element using the optimal membrane triangular OPT element for the geometrically nonlinear analysis of laminated composite structures has been introduced by Khosravi et al. [23]. Regarding the good results of DKMQ plate element, it is interesting to develop a shell element based on the generalization of DKMQ. In this paper, we will introduce a new quadrilateral shell element constituted of 4 nodes and 6 degrees of freedom per node (Section 2). This element has 24 d.o.f, is called Discrete KirchoffMindlin Quadrilateral 24 (DKMQ24). Using the Naghdi shell theory [24â27] and the formulation of shell element of [28], we have extended DKMQ plate element to DKMQ24 shell element. Its formulation is based on a generalization of the Discrete Kirchhoff Mindlin method including the transverse shear effects, and is valid for thin and thick shells. The incomplete quadratic interpolation functions for the rotation used in DKMQ24 element constitute one of the originality of the approach proposed and give the better performance in bending behavior. Warping effects are taken into account by computing the coupling bending-membrane in the curvature equations. This DKMQ24 element passed the classical patch tests in several thick and thin shell conï¬gurations and converged without shear locking towards the reference solution for benchmarks tested.

f. The formulation uses the Modiï¬ed Functional elements of Hu-Washizu [31]. g. DKMQ24 element behaves in accordance with the theory of Kirchhoff and ReissnerâMindlin, due to the use of a shear inï¬uence factor Ïk which is a function of shell thickness ratio (L/h).

2.1. Geometry of shell element The interpolation of a vector position x~q at an arbitrary point q, when expressed as functions of the parametric coordinate Î¾, Î·, z on the reference element: Ã Ã x Î¾; Î·; z Â¼ x Ã°Î¾; Î·Ã Ã¾z n Ã°Î¾; Î·Ã Ã°1Ã

2. DKMQ24 shell element The main characteristics of DKMQ24 shell element are as follows: a. The geometry of the shell is represented by a set of quadrilateral elements with bilinear approach in which four of these nodes are non-coplanar [29,30]. b. Vector position x~p in the middle surface is continuous, but the direction of normal vector n~ maybe discontinuous between two elements adjacent. c. The approximation of displacement function or translation in Ã Ã the middle surface up Î¾; Î· Ã uses a linear function, while the Ã interpolation of rotations Î²~ Î¾; Î· uses an incomplete quadratic function [29,30]. d. Shear deformation vector is approximated independently (Assumed Strain Shear Displacement Field). e. There are 24 degrees of freedom on each element, six degrees Ã Ã of freedom for each node i U i ; V i ; W i ; Î¸X i ; Î¸Y i ; Î¸Z i following the global coordinates system.

The factor Ïk (characterizing the inï¬uence of shear) maintains the consistency of element. The factor h2/L2, in that equation explains k why DKMQ24 element behaves as the ReissnerâMindlin theory for thick shell and as the KirchhoffâLove theory for thin shell. In the thin shell problems, the factor h2/L2 is close to zero, so that the k transversal shear deformation is automatically ignored, as a result the shear locking resolved by this Discrete Kirchhoff Mindlin method.

Accordingly, the stiffness matrix [k] is the sum of the stiffness matrices due to membrane, bending and transversal shear. Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã Ã k Â¼ km Ã¾ kb Ã¾ ks Ã°71Ã Stiffness matrix is determined using numerical integration with Gauss integration point. Standard Gauss integration 2 Ã 2 point is enough to integrate the stiffness matrix (65), (68) and (70). Shear strain deformation energy depends on the value of factor Ïk and this energy becomes zero if Ïk % 0. In thin shell problem (Ïk % 0), the DKMQ24 element converges to DKQ24 element in reference [29]. Therefore, shear stiffness becomes zero and there is no shear locking for thin shell with the element DKMQ24. 2.8. Fictitious stiffness for Î¸z and MacNeal stabilization In the ï¬eld of real kinematic, there is no rotation around the normal axis (Î¸z ). Then the stiffness matrix [k] (71) will contain the value zero at the nodal variables Î¸zi . As a result, it will arise four spurious modes at elements. If all elements are combined into a plane that is coplanar, then the sum of rigidity matrix (rigidity assemblage matrix) will become singular. Therefore, to avoid the difï¬culties of numerical operations (spurious modes), we used a

4. Convergence test The convergence test introduced here includes benchmark test suggested by Mac Neal and Harder [35], are: the hemispherical shell, the ScordelisâLo roof problem, the pinched cylindrical shell with end diaphragms, the hyperbolic paraboloid shell and the twisted beam. We will present also the results for plate problems in the two last examples. In all cases, the shells are analyzed with a constant thickness. The boundary conditions are known, and there is no initial deformation. 4.1. The hemispherical shell A case which is often used to evaluate the performance of a thin hemispherical shell element (R/hÂ¼250) is presented in Fig. 8. We have free boundary conditions and 4 pieces point load. This case is introduced to prove the absence of membrane locking. The structure is divided into four sections due to the symmetry. The deï¬ection UA Â¼ Ã VB which is a results of numerical test is presented in Table 2 and Fig. 9.

We can see that there are some similarities in both elements and we need only to explain the differences. The Q4Î³24 element uses bi-linear function for both u~p and Î²~.

Analytical solution (theory of shallow shell) [36]: WB Â¼ Ã3.703 cm and WC Â¼0.525 cm The case presented in Fig. 10 is a problem which is used to compare the performance of ï¬at facet approach, curved, and isoparametric. This structure has a cylindrical panel with free boundary conditions along the cylinder and on the other transverse direction ï¬eld of the panel. Geometry and mechanical characteristics can be seen in Fig. 10. This shell has its own load (vertical distributed load) fZ Â¼ Ã 0.625 Ã 104 Pa across the surface. Transversal shear deformations are very small, so they can be ignored, and the membrane deformation is more dominant

than the bending deformation. We analyzed only a quarter of the structure because of the symmetry. In this example, membrane effect is more dominant. The results of numerical test for Q4Î³24 and DKMQ24 elements are presented in Tables 3â5, and in Figs. 11â14. We observed that these elements converge to the deep shell theory solution. The results are quite similar. However, we can see once again in Tables 3 and 4 that DKMQ24 element gives better results, closer to the theoretical solution of deep shell. Table 5 and Figs. 13 and 14 present the convergence of membrane force in point B and bending moment in point C compared to the theoretical solution of shallow shell [36].

membrane where most of the structure (under concentrated load) is dominated by bending effect 770%. In this case, DKMQ24 element gives better results than Q4Î³24 element. This is due to the quadratic interpolation functions for the rotation used in DKMQ24, while Q4Î³24 element used linear interpolation functions. Presented in two thickness ratio, R/hÂ¼100 (thin shell) and R/h Â¼10 (thick shell). For R/hÂ¼100, an analytical solution (Kirchhoff) theory was proposed by Lindberg et al. [37] with respect to the solution of FlÃ¼gge [38] using Fourier series. For R/hÂ¼10, the analytical solutions (the Mindlin theory) takes into account the transversal shear effects and is

The numerical solution does not converge at all toward the reference one. DKMQ24 and Q4Î³24 elements give similar results for convergence in uniform and distorted meshes. 4.4. Hyperbolic paraboloid shell Another classic problem is the problem of a hyperbolic paraboloid shell with a distributed load in the normal direction fz. Geometry and mechanical characteristics can be viewed in Fig. 21. This particular shell has a negative Gaussian curvature with boundary conditions in the straight line. The projection on to the Z-axis is a rectangular-shaped, with bases 2a Ã 2a, and clamped on the sides. This shell geometry corresponds to a shallow shell. Table 10 and Fig. 22 present the convergence of the deï¬ection versus the number of elements. Data: a Â¼50 cm; bÂ¼10 cm; hÂ¼ 0.8 cm; E Â¼28500 kg/cm2; Ï Â¼ 0.4 fz Â¼ 0.01 kg/cm2: distributed load in the normal direction; ZÂ¼ (b/a2) XY Boundary conditions: UÂ¼ VÂ¼WÂ¼ Î¸X Â¼ Î¸Y Â¼ Î¸Z Â¼0 along sides ABCD Reference solution [40]: Wo Â¼2.460 Ã 10 Ã 2 cm We observe that the results given by Q4Î³24 and DKMQ24 elements converge to the given reference value [40]. However, the convergence with DKMQ24 element is much faster. We present in Table 10 and Fig. 22 the results given by facet shell approach with the element we called DKQ24FP in reference [29] as a superposition DKQ plate element [7] and Q4 standard quadrilateral membrane element with 4 nodes and degree of freedom ui, vi in each node i. The ï¬ctitious stiffness for Î¸z and MacNeal stabilization is added into DKQ24FP element stiffness to avoid rigid body motion. We can see clearly the facet shell DKQ24FP element gives the different results with DKMQ24 shell element proposed in this paper. In this example DKMQ24 gives the same results with DKQ24 in reference [29] since the shear deformations are very small. 4.5. Twisted beam Data: Rotation Â¼901 between O and A L Â¼12 m; bÂ¼1.1 m; hÂ¼ 0.0032 m and 0.32 m; EÂ¼ 29 Ã 106 Pa; Ï Â¼ 0.22 Boundary condition: UÂ¼ VÂ¼W Â¼ Î¸X Â¼ Î¸Y Â¼ Î¸Z Â¼ 0 on the support Geometry of the middle surface with respect to s and Î¸: X Â¼s cos Î¸; Y Â¼2Î¸L/Ï; Z Â¼s sin Î¸; 0 r Î¸ r Ï/2; Ã 0.5b r s r Ã¾0.5b This example addressed is a shell with helicoidal shaped with one side clamped. A concentrated load is applied on the other side (Fig. 23). This test was introduced by MacNeal and Harder [35] and became one of major tests to validate a new shell element. This case presents important difï¬culties for the elements resulting from the ï¬at facet shell approach in quadrilateral shaped. The element facet shell DKQ24FP in [29] (superposition of membrane and ï¬exural/transversal shear, without the curved side) gives the same difï¬culties. We can see in Tables 11â14 and Figs. 24â27 the results given by DKQ24FP are divergent from reference values. The reference solution is based on the beam theory (which ignores the deformation in transverse direction), and with or without taking into account the transverse shear deformation. For this example we can see that the DKMQ24 proposed in this paper gives the same results with DKQ24 element in reference [29]. The results obtained for h Â¼0.0032 m and 0.32 m are presented in Figs. 24â27 and Tables 11â14 with meshing 2 Ã 12, 4 Ã 24, 6 Ã 36 and 8 Ã 48 respectively. DKMQ24 and Q4Î³24 elements give satisfactory and similar results converging towards the reference solution.

presented in Bhaskar and Varadan [39]. In the 2 cases, only 1/8 of the cylinder may be analyzed accounting for the symmetries. Moreover, the uniform and distorted meshes are analyzed. A bias factor of 10 was used for distorted mesh. The numerical results (WC versus the number the elements) obtained with the different elements for R/hÂ¼100 and 10 are presented in Tables 6â9 and in Figs. 16â20. We can see, in particular in Fig. 16, that DKMQ24 element converges much faster than Q4Î³24 element. For N Â¼10 (NELT Â¼100), DKMQ24 has nearly converged, whereas Q4Î³24 gives results far from the reference value. Fig. 17 presents the comparison of bending moment MX along DC with [37] using 16 Ã 16 elements. The results obtained with DKMQ24 element are closer to the reference solution than those obtained with Q4Î³24 element. The same results are also obtained with distorted mesh in Fig. 18. In Case 2 for R/hÂ¼ 10 (thick shell), results presented in Figs. 19 and 20, reveal the effects of transversal shear. Indeed, the elements DKQ24 [29] (similar to DKMQ24 element which does not take into account the effect of transversal shearÏk Â¼ 0) gives less satisfactory results than the Q4Î³24 and DKMQ24 elements.

Note that for plate problems, Q4Î³24 element has been developed following [1,2] and is therefore similar to MITC4 element for plate. DKMQ24 and Q4Î³24 elements give satisfactory and similar results converging towards the reference solution. Moreover, the results reveal that DKMQ24 and Q4Î³24 are not sensitive to distortion.

5. Conclusions The new four nodes and 24 dof quadrilateral shell element DKMQ24, using incomplete quadratic interpolation functions for the rotation, has been evaluated and presented in thick and thin shell problems. The results of the analysis show that this element passed all convergence test presented, without membrane locking. It is also free of shear-locking, as for the DKMQ plate element [13]. In membrane dominated problems (ScordelisâLo roof for instance), the results are quite similar because both elements use the same membrane stiffness matrix. In bending dominated problems (pinched cylindrical shell), results obtained with DKMQ24 element are much better, in particular the convergence is faster than with Q4Î³24 element. This is due to the quadratic interpolation functions for the rotation used in DKMQ24. For thick pinched cylindrical shell, DKMQ24 and Q4Î³24 elements give similar results for convergence while DKQ24 element [29] gives less satisfactory results because it does not take into account the effect of transversal shear. For shell analysis which has a negative
