a quick introduction

H

i, my name is Steven Keating and I am entering my ï¬fth year of graduate studies in Mechanical Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Iâll try to keep my history brief and let the projects speak for themselves. As a child, our basement quickly became the neighborhood electronic facility, much to the chagrin of my chartered accounting parents. From VCRs to microwave ovens, I took them all apart and was fascinated with creating new inventions from their components. From Tesla coils to weather balloons to ion motors, my childhood creations always intrigued my friends and family alike. It was in these early days of tinkering that I discovered my love for innovation and strong sense of curiosity. In college, I graduated top of my class with dual undergraduate degrees in Mechanical and Materials Engineering (B.Sc) and Film and Media (B.A.) at Queenâs University, Canada. While this degree combination of engineering and ï¬lm may seem unusual, I believe new perspectives on different ï¬elds are an ideal source for innovation. I also draw creative potential through as many eclectic experiences as I can gather. From teaching product design in Saudi Arabia, to competing in Peru for the Jr. Pan-American games in badminton, to presenting movies at ï¬lm festivals in Los Angeles, I strongly believe in a diverse knowledge base to draw ideas from. Currently, I am working under Dr. Neri Oxman in the MIT Media Lab working on a range of design ideas surrounding rapid fabrication, biomimicry, and smart materials. What follows is a brief selection of my projects. Please feel free to contact me with questions, ideas, or just to say hi! Hope you are having a splendid day, -Steven

functionally graded 3D printing
Functionally graded materials, which are materials with spatially varying composition or microstructure, are omnipresent in nature. From palm trees with radial density gradients, to the spongy trabecular structure of bone, to the hardness gradient found in many types of beaks, graded materials offer material and structure efï¬ciency. Yet in man-made structures, such as concrete pillars, materials are typically volumetrically homogenous. While using homogenous materials allows for ease of production, improvements in strength, weight, and material usage can be obtained by designing with functionally graded materials. To achieve graded material objects, we are working to construct a 3D printer capable of dynamic mixing of composition material. Starting with concrete and UV-curable polymers, we aim to create structures, such as a boneinspired beam, which have functionally graded materials. This project is headed by Dr. Neri Oxman and I am the lead graduate student working on the research. We envision a future where 3D CAD ï¬les contain not only geometry and material, but also how that material varies along the given geometry. By bringing functionally graded materials into digital design, more efï¬cient and functional use of materials is possible. For instance, take the concrete system we are currently working on (photo below of samples). By having the ability to control density, aggregate ratio, and water ratio of the concrete at any given position, we can create graded structures which are lighter, stronger, and use less material. A good example is the radial density gradient, shown below, which mimics a the cellular structures of a palm tree and trabecular bone.

functionally graded 3D printing
To construct the functionally graded 3D printer, we are utilizing a 6-axes robotic arm (bottom left) as a test platform. The additional 3 axes (traditional 3D printers use only XYZ axes) allow for novel developments in 3D printing which hold great promise, such as pick-and-place embedded printing of parts. Currently, weâve developed custom software to run the arm and are successfully able to print plastic objects (top right). By having exchangeable extruder print heads, we are able to print a variety of materials. To enable functionally graded printing, we utilize dynamic mixing prior to extrusion. Just like the analogue of mixing paints, we are able to control output material properties by controlling the mixture of input components. For concrete, we have constructed an extruder head which mixes a foaming agent with compressed air to give precise control over the output density. We are currently testing this extruder head and have be able to produce samples ranging in density from 20 pounds per cubic foot to 100 pounds per cubic foot. For the UV polymer graded printing, we utilize two polymers with different chain lengths and control the extruded material stiffness by mixing these two input components. These design and fabrication tools hold enormous potential in the world of digital fabrication and open new avenues for functionality of parts. Instead of having two hard plastic pieces hinged together, now a solid hinge of a more ï¬exible polymer can join the two stiff parts, integrating the functionality into a single monolithic piece. We are also thinking large-scale. Looking back to nature, we notice a trend of swarm construction, for example, how miniscule termites work collaboratively to construct massive termite mounds. We envision the use of swarm printing in the future, where robots can print structures larger than themselves (bottom right).

morphable material
What if a materialâs stiffness and geometry can be digitally controlled? Jammable materials offer the ability to rapidly tune a systemâs stiffness, opening a new world of design possibilities. Granular materials can be put into a jammed state through the application of pressure to achieve a pseudo-solid material with controllable rigidity and geometry. This phenomenon occurs in granular materials when the individual particles are packed together, causing the friction and Van der Waals forces between grains to increase. The prototypes in this study have utilized vacuum pumps to create jammed states through the weight of the atmosphere on the jammed particles. Depending on the level of vacuum, the rigidity of the pseudo-solid system can be manipulated. While jamming principles have been long known, large-scale applications of jammed structures have not been signiï¬cantly explored. As well, potential speciï¬c applications are highlighted and demoed. Such applications range from a morphable chair, to a ï¬exible vice, to artistic free-form sculpting.

Seen above is the morphable chair which can be rapidly switched from a very ï¬exible state (top left), to a sturdy, weight-support state (bottom left) through the jamming effect. Other designs created using this effect include a universal joint with tuneable stiffness (bottom left) and a jammable vice (bottom right) for holding objects during machining. These simple systems are extremely cost-effective, novel, and offer signiï¬cant potential in a range of applications. A provisional patent has been ï¬led for several of these designs.

testing and casting with morphable materials
One of the aims of the research is to provide a design guide for jammable materials to allow others to better explore these granular systems. To that end, much of the work has been in performing mechanical testing to create guidelines and strength ratings of different granular systems (right). We are also investigating the idea of granular composites, such as mixtures of sand and jacks, to optimize the jammed strength and maximize the unjammed ï¬exibility. The project is exploring additional design avenues for morphable materials. Picture below is the use of jammable systems in a casting application. An object can be rapidly replicated using this technique, with the additional beneï¬ts of easy demolding and re-usability. As well, lowtemperature metals can be directly cast with the use of high temperature silicone elastomers. Finally, creative applications in art and design are explored through visual sculptures and the use of transparent media to create pressure-dependent light recordings (bottom right). A proof-of-concept sculpture model is completely self-contained and can be inï¬nitely re-sculpted, both through its geometry and light emission.

real-life rendering

Through the use of long-exposure photography, this project aims to develop a new form of animation where graphics are rendered in real-life, as opposed to rendered digitally on a screen. Rendering in reality allows for real-world input, for example from sensors, to display environmental data typically invisible to the human eye. For instance, the photograph in the bottom right shows the magnetic ï¬eld lines given off by a laptop. This is achieved through moving a sensor and light source through a scene and recording the information through long-exposure photography. As the sensor informs the light source, hidden ï¬elds, such as radio waves, WiFi ï¬elds, and other ï¬elds, become visible in these photographs. Utilizing a 6-axis robotic arm to precisely move through the scene allows for detailed volumetric renderings to be generated. In fact, any 3D shape ï¬le in a computer can be rendered in real-life through this technique, such as seen in the happy face photograph above. Films can be made through successively still frames, generating a new animation form which is a hybrid of both traditional stop animation and modern computer graphics.

Looking to develop additive manufacturing processes on the building-scale offers many challenges. 3D printing technologies have revolutionized small part prototyping, but scaling to construction-sized objects presents problems due to cost, speed, and physical size. For instance, to print a ofï¬ce building by simply scaling current 3D printing technologies would require a printer larger than the building itself and would take weeks, if not months to print. To solve these problems, an approach has been developed based on natural inspiration of termites. Termites utilize swarm construction principles to create structures much larger than themselves, up to 30 feet sometimes! To mimic this approach, small robots have been developed that can print foam structures larger than themselves. These foam walls dry immediately and can then be ï¬lled with concrete to provide a structural wall element. In additional, the foam molds then act as insulation to provide an insulated concrete building. This approach is extremely fast, cost effective, and offers complex, non-linear geometries for architecture. To date, large walls have been successfully printed and a full-scale building is planned for the near future.

Sulico is a company started in late 2010 through the MIT course Development Ventures with 5 other team members. Sulico is a social venture that will provide community-centric solar energy production and distribute energy as a service for rural Africa. Our vision is to develop generation capacity and decentralized access that can evolve to form rural electriï¬cation systems (micro-grids), starting with Ghana. By providing energy as a service through community engagement, we present a unique value proposition that can address the current barrier of affordability and distribution in bringing energy solutions to West Africa. Currently, over 40% of Ghanaian households (1.8 million households) still do not have access to electricity, even though electricity consumption in Ghana has been growing at an annual rate of around 15% annually. These households spend on average $4/month on kerosene for lighting. Moreover, the lowest income households connected to the electric grid spend on average $5/month (35kWh) for electricity. These households lacking power corresponds to a total potential annual market between $85M and $110M. Site Implementation Based on the population, the solar irradiance, and grid deployment, Sulico has selected the Eastern part of the Greater Accra region as the ï¬rst implementation site. The primary target communities represent village clusters of around 1,500 households. The typical franchise will be located within the sites that are central to community life. Sulico will provide the cooperatives with: â¢ Installation and training: Sulico will procure the hardware necessary and perform the initial installation. Training will be delivered both on the technical installation and the business operations. â¢ Maintenance and supply-chain: The local workforce will handle the daily operations, whereas Sulico will facilitate the planned maintenance and supply chain. This will allow the local partners to focus on developing the business with the end customers while maintaining an open communication channel with Sulico. â¢ Financing package: By partnering with ï¬nancial institutions such as MFIs (ProCredit) and rural banks (Shai Rural Bank Ltd), Sulico will allow the local cooperatives to own part of the electricity production facility (typically 20%). Sulico has been awarded several grants, inlcluding a Legatum Center seed grant, and currently has team members onsite in West Africa testing a trial run (below).

digitally cleaning ancient artifacts
What if you could clean an artifact without having to physical touch it or risk damaging it? Traditionally, archaeologists have had to balance the use of physical techniques for artifact excavation, cleaning, and examination with the concern for potential damages to the sample. While this remains true for excavation, technological advances in non-destructive measurements and imaging techniques have recently been successfully applied to cultural heritage ï¬elds. The use of non-destructive imaging allows for efï¬cient analysis of samples without the risk of physical damage. My undergraduate thesis work focused on two of these technologies, x-ray computed tomography (CT) and neutron CT, which offer three-dimensional imaging capabilities of external and internal artifact features. The two different scanning techniques were found to compliment each other in analyzing ancient GrecoRoman coins (from the Diniacopoulos Collection of Queenâs University), as the x-ray contrast is dependent on the Z-number, while the neutron contrast is dependent on the neutron cross-section. This work successfully identiï¬ed numerous corroded ancient coins and the algorithms developed will work for other metallic artifacts. For more information, please see: Â  H. Nguyen, S. Keating, G. Bevan, A. Gabov, M. Daymond, B. Schillinger, A. Muray. (2010) Seeing through Corrosion: Using Micro-focus X-ray Computed Tomography to Digitally âCleanâ Ancient Bronze Coins.

nanocolumn InGaN photovoltaic design
Currently, the main obstacle to solar panel proliferation is cost. During the summer of 2009, I started work under Dr. Joshua Pearce looking at ways to improve photovoltaic efï¬ciency and reduce material expenses. The topic of research was indium gallium nitride (InGaN), which is a new potential photovoltaic material. Both the optical and structural properties of InGaN were of interest as InGaN has been shown to have a tuneable band gap (from 0.4 eV to 3.4 eV depending on the indium content). This is an promising material, as most semiconductors used for solar cells have ï¬xed band gaps and the band gap of a material dictates what frequencies of light the material can absorb. Most commercial solar cells are single-junction cells, meaning that only one band gap is used to collect solar energy. Newer, multi-junction cells function similarly to a stack of single-junction cells, and can collect a wider range of frequencies using different materials for each junction. These higher efï¬ciencies multi-junction cells currently exist, but are expensive and require careful processing to get the different materials to have proper lattice matching. InGaN offers a unique opportunity, as a multi-junction cell could be made with all of the junctions containing InGaN. The different junctions would only have to have slightly varying compositions of indium to achieve the required varying band gaps. This means lattice matching would be signiï¬cantly easier, and the material costs are inexpensive compared to the high-purity silicon currently used. While the main driving factor for solar InGaN research is the tuneable band gap, another interesting avenue is the microstructure. This past summer, my work revealed the nanocolumnar growth present in our method of InGaN deposition. These nanocolumns offer an interesting method to easily creating a three-dimensional solar cell. If the columnar structure could be maintained in a solar cell, the extra surface area and reï¬ection properties will improve absorption and efï¬ciency when compared to the standard planar geometry. The photos below detail the nanocolumnar structure observed in our deposited InGaN samples. My work discovered these structures (seen below in scanning electron microscopy), linked their crystallinity to the indium content, and modeled a multi-junction photovoltaic cell around this tuneable band gap semiconductor. For more information, please see our recently published paper: S. Keating, M. G. Urquhart, D. V. P. McLaughlin, and J. M. Pearce. (2011) Effects of Substrate Temperature on Indium Gallium Nitride Nanocolumn Crystal Growth. Crystal Growth and Design. V.11, Pg. 565-568

side projects film
I am an avid photographer and video enthusiast and I often build side projects around ï¬lm. Past work has included many short ï¬lms, commercials, education videos and documentaries. I highly subscribe to the power of visuals for communication and evocating emotion. Some of my work can be viewed online at www.stevenkeating.info.

tinkering
It is hard to group all of the past side projects Iâve embarked on; ranging from homemade night vision (below), to radio trackers (top right), to careening down hills on a homemade street luge (middle right. I can best describe it as a passion for curiosity and inventing, or tinkering. Another good example is a amateur radio weather balloon project where a homemade GPS transmitter and camera was attached to a salvaged military weather balloon (bottom right). One of the latest project I have embarked on is an underwater robot capable of diving full ocean depth (over 6 miles deep). By using a novel pressure-tolerant design and homemade sensors, a cost under $100 was maintained. These small projects may seem all different, but the unifying theme is of innovation and design. While these projects are entertaining, they also allow me to quickly explore areas that could lead to future research. The morphable materials project grew out of a quick side experiment and is now a full-ï¬edged project.
