Abstract A new quadrilateral shell element with 5/6 nodal degrees of freedom is presented. Assuming linear isotropic elasticity a HellingerâReissner functional with independent displacements, rotations and stress resultants is used. Within the mixed formulation the stress resultants are interpolated using ï¬ve parameters for the membrane forces as well as for the bending moments and four parameters for the shear forces. The hybrid element stiï¬ness matrix resulting from the stationary condition is integrated analytically. This leads to a part obtained by one point integration and a stabilization matrix. The element possesses the correct rank, is free of locking and is applicable within the whole range of thin and thick shells. The inâplane and bending patch tests are fulï¬lled and the computed numerical examples show that the convergence behaviour of the stress resultants is very good in comparison to comparable existing elements. The essential advantage is the fast stiï¬ness computation due to the analytically integrated matrices.

Introduction

Computational shell analysis is based on stress resultant theories e.g. [1, 2] or on the soâ called degenerated approach [3]. New developments in this ï¬eld are discussed in e.g. [4, 5]. In the following only the main computational aspects are considered. Although the hypothesis underlying the degenerated approach and classical shell theory are essentially the same, the reduction to resultant form is typically carried out numerically in the former, and analytically in the latter, [6]. Many of the computational shell models consider transverse shear deformations within a ReissnerâMindlin theory [7], [8] to byâpass the diï¬culties caused by C 1 ârequirements of the Kirchhoï¬âLove theory, see e.g. [9, 10, 11]. Generally, shell behaviour is extremely sensitive to initial geometry and imperfections, thus a successful correlation between theory and analysis is achieved only after including speciï¬c details of these quantities. Low order elements like quadrilaterals based on standard displacement interpolation are usually characterized by locking phenomena. In shells two types of locking occur: transverse shear locking in which bending modes are excluded and nearly all energy is stored in transverse shear terms, and; membrane locking in which all bending energy is restrained and energy is stored in membrane terms. Elements which exhibit a locking tendency lead to unacceptable stiï¬ results when reasonable ï¬nite element meshes are employed. In attempting to avoid locking, reduced integration methods have often been advocated, see e.g. [12]. Use of reduced (or selective reduced) integration is often accompanied by spurious zero energy modes. Hence, authors have developed stabilization techniques to regain the correct rank of the element stiï¬ness matrix, e.g. [13, 14, 9]. In some cases, however, results computed using these formulations turned out to be sensitive to the ad hoc hourglass control parameters. Furthermore these elements do not fulï¬ll the bending patch test. An eï¬ective method to avoid transverse shear locking is based on assumed shear strain ï¬elds ï¬rst proposed in [15], and subsequently extended and reformulated in [16, 17, 18, 19].

Mixed variational principles provide the basis for the discussed ï¬nite element techniques. Assuming linear elasticity a HellingerâReissner functional has been used in e.g. [20, 21]. Ref. [20] describe a quadrilateral element with assumed stresses for membrane, bending and shear parts whereas in Ref [21] explicit stabilization matrices for a nine node element have been derived. For general nonlinear material behaviour a three ï¬eld variational functional with independent displacements, stresses and strains is more appropriate. Within the soâ called enhanced strain formulations the independent stresses are eliminated from the set of equations using orthogonality conditions and a two ï¬eld formulation remains, [22]. For shells this method has been applied enhancing the GreenâLagrangean membrane strains e.g. in [23]. The drawbacks in [13, 14, 9] have been overcome in [24]. The theory is based on a HuâWashizu threeâï¬eld variational principle with independent displacements, stresses and strains. The stabilization matrix is derived from the orthogonality between the constant part of the strain ï¬eld and the non-constant part using 5 degrees of freedom at each node. In this context we also refer to [25] where an updated Lagrangian approach is used. Further developments for diï¬erent boundary value problems are considered in [26], where stabilization matrices on basis of the enhanced strain method have been derived. An important issue within the context of developing a ï¬nite shell model is the number and type of rotational parameters on the element. Mostly general shell theories exclude explicit dependence of a rotational ï¬eld about the normal to the shell surface which leads to a ï¬ve parameter model (three displacements and two local rotations). Use of 5 degreeâofâfreedom frame requires construction of special coordinate systems for the rotational parameters. Considering the soâcalled drilling degree-ofâfreedom leads to a ï¬nite element discretization with six nodal parameters. This has some advantages since both displacement and rotation parameters are associated with a global coordinate frame. On the other hand a larger set of algebraic equations has to be solved. In this context we mention the fourânode shell element according to [27] with three global displacements and three global rotations at each node. The element employs a membrane interpolation ï¬eld with drilling degreesâofâfreedom. The bending stiï¬ness is based on the discrete Kirchhoï¬ theory. For arbitrary shaped elements a transformation of the stiï¬ness matrix, which considers the warping eï¬ects, leads to good results also for a nonâï¬at geometry. The element [27] has been widely used in the literature for comparisons, e.g. in [10] and in the present paper. The essential features and new contributions of the present formulation are summarized as follows: (i) Assuming linear elasticity the variational formulation of the shearâelastic shell is based on the HellingerâReissner principle. We specify the shape functions for the independent stress resultants, where the interpolation of the membrane forces and of the bending moments corresponds to the approach in [10]. Here, the new contribution is the analytical integration of the matrices, which leads to a oneâpoint integrated part and an explicit stabilization matrix. This requires the replacement of the variable base vectors and director vectors by those of the element center, which corresponds to a projection on a ï¬at surface, see also [27]. For warped elements the above mentioned transformation according to [27] is implemented. (ii) The interpolation of the shear forces along with assumed shear strains and the explicit matrix representation of the stabilization matrix is a further new contribution. 3

(iii) The element possesses with six zero eigenvalues the correct rank. No control parameters have to be chosen to prevent locking or to avoid hourâglassing. The inâplane and bending patch tests are fulï¬lled. Especially the convergence behaviour of the stress resultants is superior to comparable fourânode shell elements. The main advantage is the fast stiï¬ness computation. In our implementation the present formulation requires only about 60% of the computing time to setup the global stiï¬ness matrix compared with the element [27]. (iv) The element formulation allows the analysis of shells with intersections. At all nodes which are not positioned on intersections the drilling degree of freedom is ï¬xed. Thus, the nodal degrees of freedom are: three global displacements components, three global rotations at nodes on intersections and two local rotations at other nodes.

Kinematics and Variational Formulation

Let B0 be the threeâdimensional Euclidean space occupied by the shell in the unâdeformed conï¬guration with boundary âB0 . The position vector Î¦ of any point P â B0 is associated with the global coordinate frame ei Î¦(Î¾ 1 , Î¾ 2 , Î¾ 3 ) = Î¦i ei = X + Î¾ 3 D(Î¾ 1 , Î¾ 2 ) with |D(Î¾ 1 , Î¾ 2 )| = 1 and â h h â¤ Î¾3 â¤ 2 2 (1)

with the position vector X(Î¾ 1 , Î¾ 2 ) of the shell midâsurface â¦, the shell thickness h, and Î¾ i the convected coordinate system of the body. A director D(Î¾ 1 , Î¾ 2 ) is deï¬ned as a vector perpendicular to the shell midâsurface. The usual summation convention is used, where Latin indices range from 1 to 3 and Greek indices range from 1 to 2. Commas denote partial diï¬erentiation with respect to the coordinates Î¾ i . Hence, the geometry of the deformed shell space B is described by Ï(Î¾ 1 , Î¾ 2 , Î¾ 3 ) = Ïi ei = x(Î¾ 1 , Î¾ 2 ) + Î¾ 3 d(Î¾ 1 , Î¾ 2 ) with d = D + âd . (2)

With the kinematic assumption (2) shear deformations are accounted for and thus d is not normal to the deformed shell midâsurface. Â¯ Inserting the position vectors (1) and (2) in the linear strain tensor Îµ one obtains Â¯ Â¯ Îµ = Îµij Gi â Gj ÎµÎ±Î² = ÎµÎ±Î² + Î¾ 3 ÎºÎ±Î² Â¯ 2 ÎµÎ±3 = Î³Î± Â¯ Îµ33 = 0 , Â¯ (3)

For a quadrilateral element we exploit the isoparametric concept with coordinates Î¾ and Î· deï¬ned in the unit square {Î¾, Î·} â [â1, 1]. Hence the position vector and the director vector of the shell midâsurface are interpolated using the biâlinear functions NI = 1 (1 + Î¾I Î¾)(1 + Î·I Î·) = a0I + a1I Î¾ + a2I Î· + hI Î¾Î· 4 Î¾I â {â1, 1, 1, â1} a0I =

where the index h denotes the ï¬nite element approximation. The position vectors XI and the local cartesian basis systems akI , k = 1, 2, 3 are generated within the mesh input. Here, DI = a3I is perpendicular to â¦ and a1I , a2I are constructed in such a way that the boundary conditions can be accommodated. With (10)2 the orthogonality is only given at the nodes. Furthermore, a local cartesian basis ti is introduced at the element center Â¯ d1 = X3 â X1 Â¯ d2 = X2 â X4 t1 = (d1 + d2 )/|d1 + d2 | t2 = (d1 â d2 )/|d1 â d2 | t3 = t1 Ã t2 The shell midâsurface described by (10)1 is in general a nonâplanar surface â¦h , whereas the ï¬at projection introduced by t1 and t2 is denoted by â¦h , see Fig. 1 and Ref.

Transverse Shear Strains

The fulï¬llment of the bending patch test is discussed in [28], where for a plate it is shown, that with the transverse shear strains (4)3 the patch test can not be fulï¬lled within the 6

present mixed formulation. The non constant part of the shear strains according to (4)3 leads for a constant stress state to a contribution of the shear energy on the element level. For this reason we approximate the shear strains with independent interpolation functions proposed in [18, 19] as follows Î³1 Î³2

The strains at the midside nodes A, B, C, D according to Fig. 1 are speciï¬ed as follows

(15)

Remark: An alternative three ï¬eld variational formulation based on a HuâWashizu principle for the shear part, which would be the appropriate variational formulation for an independent shear interpolation, leads to identical ï¬nite element matrices due to the fact that the shear stiï¬ness matrix is diagonal.

Transformation of the Element Matrices

Since the interpolation of the stress resultants are discontinuous at the element boundaries and with Î´v = 0, Î´Î² = 0, the parameters Î² can be eliminated on the element level considering (24) (32) Î² = Hâ1 G v . 11

The assembly can be performed as within a pure displacement formulation. However, at ï¬rst the nodal force vector S0 = [S01 , S02 , S03 , S04 ]T has to be transformed considering the distance vector rI between â¦h and â¦h at the nodes, see Fig. 1 and Ref.

Here, k0 denotes the stiï¬ness of a oneâpoint integrated ReissnerâMindlin shell element with assumed shear strains and kstab the stabilization matrix. The matrix h according to (26) consists of three submatrices of order two and thus can easily be inverted. The element stiï¬ness matrix possesses with six zero eigenvalues the correct rank.

Examples

The derived element formulation has been implemented in an extended version of the general purpose ï¬nite element program FEAP, see Zienkiewicz and Taylor [30].

Membrane and bending patch test

Here we investigate a rectangular plate under membrane forces and bending moments according to [33]. Both, membrane and bending patch test are fulï¬lled by the present element.

4.2

Corner supported square plate

A corner supported plate with edge length 2a subjected to uniform load is discussed. Considering symmetry the mesh consists of 8 Ã 8 elements for a quarter of the plate, see Fig. 2. The geometrical and material data are also given. An approximate ansatz according to [34] reads (41) w(x, y) = c1 + c2 x2 + c3 y 2 + c4 x4 + c5 x2 y 2 + c6 y 4 , where the origin of the co-ordinate system lies in the center of the plate. The boundary condition of vanishing bending moments at the edges can only be fulï¬lled in an integral sense. The other boundary conditions and the partial diï¬erential equation can be fulï¬lled exactly. The constants are determined and thus for y = 0 the approximate Kirchhoï¬ solution reads Î½ Î½2 x 4 qa4 2 2 x 2 [11 â 6Î½ â Î½ + (â5 + 4Î½ + Î½ )( ) + (1 + â )( ) ] . w(x, y = 0) = 2Eh3 a 2 2 a a h q E Î½ = = = = = 12 0.375 0.03125 430000 0.38

Hemispherical shell with a 18â¦ hole

The hemispherical shell with a 18â¦ hole under opposite loads is a standard example in linear and nonlinear shell analysis. The material properties are E = 6.825 Â· 107 and Î½ = 0.3, the radius is R = 10 and the thickness is h = 0.04. Considering symmetry conditions a quarter of the shell is modelled with a regular mesh, see Fig. 4. Table 1 presents results for the displacement of the loaded node for diï¬erent elements. The values are normalized with respect to our converged solution w = 0.0935 for F = 1. Analytical solutions based on asymptotic expansions are reported in [10] with w = 0.093. In Ref. [33] a value of w = 0.094 has been used for normalization. It can be seen that the results obtained with the present element as well as the results using the elements [27], [23] converge against the same solution. For this example the convergence behaviour of the investigated elements is practically the same.

Twisted beam

This problem, a clamped beam twisted 90â¦ subjected to two diï¬erent concentrated loads at the tip, was originally introduced by MacNeal and Harder [33]. A more demanding thin shell version was proposed by Jetteur [35] and is investigated in this paper. The example is chosen to test the assess of warping on the performance of shell elements. Two load cases are discussed. Load case 1 is a unit shear load in width direction whereas load case 2 is a unit shear load in thickness direction, see Fig. 6. The computed tip displacements in load direction are normalized with respect to our converged solutions 1.387 (load case 1) and 0.343 (load case 2) and are presented in Tab. 3. The displacements uz and uy are plotted for the respective load case on the deformed conï¬gurations in Fig. 7.

Figure 8: Hypar shell: geometrical and material data The geometry of the considered hyperbolic paraboloid shell is described by the function z = 1/8 xy. The shell is loaded by a constant load pz per shell middle surface in vertical Â¯ direction. Along the boundary the deï¬ections are restrained in global zâdirection. Furthermore the boundary conditions ux (âl/2, 0) = ux (l/2, 0) = 0 and uy (0, âl/2) = uy (0, l/2) = 0 are considered. An analytical Kirchhoï¬ solution with slightly diï¬erent boundary conditions using Fourier series has been derived by Duddeck [36]. The shell with coordinates z(l/2, l/2) = Â±f = l/32 is rather ï¬at. Therefore the support perpendicular to the shell which has been considered in [36] does not lead to signiï¬cant diï¬erent results. The geometrical and material data as well as a typical ï¬nite element mesh are depicted in Fig. 8. The distribution of the global displacement w = uz is symmetric with respect to x = 0 and y = 0. In Fig. 9 the deï¬ection w (0 < x < l/2, y = 0) is depicted. The calculated results are in good agreement with the solution of Duddeck. Furthermore the distribution of the bending moment mxy (0 < x < l/2, y = l/2) is presented in this Figure. Diï¬erences occur along the edges due to the fact that the analytical solution is based on a Kirchhoï¬ theory whereas the numerical solution is calculated using the ReissnerâMindlin theory. In Fig. 10 the distribution of the bending moment mx (0 < x < l/2, y = 0) and mx (x = 0, 0 < y < l/2) are shown. The good agreement with the analytical solution is noted.

Steel frame structure

In the last example we discuss a symmetrical frame structure with welded crossâsections, see Figs. 11, 12. Thus, diï¬erent intersections of plates occur, which can be treated with the present model. The frame is loaded by a constant vertical load p = 16 kN/m. The Â¯ problem with all geometrical data as well as the load distribution is presented in Fig. 11, the underlying data for the crossâsections of a beam model are depicted in Fig. 12. Elastic material behaviour is assumed using the parameters E = 21000 kN/cm2 and Î½ = 0.3.

Figure 12: Deï¬nition of cross sections The ï¬nite element calculations are performed with the developed shell element using a mesh with 530 nodes and 368 elements, see Fig. 13, and for comparison with 15 twoâ dimensional beam elements, see Fig. 17. It can be seen from Tables 7 and 8 that the results of all used three shell elements are very similar for the vertical displacement uz (0, 0, 400) in the symmetry plane as well as for the stresses Ï11 in axial direction at the coordinates (0, 0, 420) and (0, 0, 380). This could also be veriï¬ed using the beam model with only little deviations. In detail Fig. 13 show the unâdeformed and deformed mesh, whereas the axial 22

stresses Ï11 at the plate midâsurfaces are depicted in Figs. 15 and 16. Finally Fig. 17 presents the associated results for the beam model. Here, normal forces of N = â72.6 kN and N = â96.0 kN occur in the horizontal member and the column of the frame. It should be noted that only the shell model is able to analyze the stress state in the corner of the frame (see Fig. 16).

Conclusions

The main aspect of the present work is to derive a fourânode shell element with explicit representation of the stiï¬ness matrix. The formulation with 5 or 6 nodal degrees of freedom is applicable for shell problems with intersections. The element possesses a correct rank, is free of locking, and can be used for the structural analysis of thin and thick shells. The computed results obtained for various shell problems with positive and negative Gaussian curvature are very satisfactory. Especially the convergence behaviour of the stress resultants is superior to comparable elements. The essential advantage is the fast stiï¬ness computation due to the analytically derived stiï¬ness matrix.
