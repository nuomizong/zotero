Abstract The computational design of a composite where the properties of its constituents change gradually within a unit cell can be successfully achieved by means of a material design method that combines topology optimization with homogenization. This is an iterative numerical method, which leads to changes in the composite material unit cell until desired properties (or performance) are obtained. Such method has been applied to several types of materials in the last few years. In this work, the objective is to extend the material design method to obtain functionally graded material architectures, i.e. materials that are graded at the local level (e.g. microstructural level). Consistent with this goal, a continuum distribution of the design variable inside the ﬁnite element domain is considered to represent a fully continuous material variation during the design process. Thus the topology optimization naturally leads to a smoothly graded material system. To illustrate the theoretical and numerical approaches, numerical examples are provided. The homogenization method is veriﬁed by considering one-dimensional material gradation proﬁles for which analytical solutions for the effective elastic properties are available. The

veriﬁcation of the homogenization method is extended to two dimensions considering a trigonometric material gradation, and a material variation with discontinuous derivatives. These are also used as benchmark examples to verify the optimization method for functionally graded material cell design. Finally the inﬂuence of material gradation on extreme materials is investigated, which includes materials with near-zero shear modulus, and materials with negative Poisson’s ratio.

1 Introduction Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs) possess continuously graded properties and are characterized by spatially varying microstructures created by nonuniform distributions of the reinforcement phase as well as by interchanging the role of reinforcement and matrix (base) materials in a continuous manner. The smooth variation of properties may offer advantages such as local reduction of stress concentration and increased bonding strength (see, for example, Miyamoto et al. 1999; Suresh and Mortensen 1988; Paulino et al. 2003).

Optimal design of periodic functionally graded composites with prescribed properties

Standard composites result from the combination of two or more materials, usually resulting in materials that offer advantages over conventional materials. The unit cell is the smallest structure that is periodic in the composite matrix. By changing the volume fraction of the constituents, the shape of the inclusions, or even the topology of the unit cell, we can obtain different effective properties for the composite material (Torquato 2002). Therefore, when designing composites, we can tailor the properties to a speciﬁc application (which, in general, cannot be done with a single material). At the macroscale observation, traditional composites (e.g. laminated) exhibit a sharp interface among the constituent phases which may cause problems such as stress concentration, and scattering (if a wave is propagating inside the material), among others. However, a material made using the FGM concept would maintain some of the advantages of traditional composites and alleviate problems related to the presence of sharp interfaces at the macroscale. The design of the composite material itself is a difﬁcult task, and the design of a composite where the properties of its constituent materials change gradually in the unit cell domain is even more complex. Meanwhile, this design can be successfully achieved by using a material design method, as described below. The overall objective of material design is to generate composite materials with prescribed or improved properties not found in common materials. This can be achieved by modifying the microstructure of the composite material (Torquato 2002). In traditional composite designs, such as ﬁber- or sphere-reinforced and laminated materials, the change in the properties is obtained by modifying the location, orientation, material constituents, or volume fraction of the ﬁber, sphere, or laminar inclusion, respectively (Cherkaev and Kohn 1997). This allows some control of the composite properties. A more systematic approach to design composite materials has been developed in recent years, which combines topology optimization with homogenization to change the composite material unit cell topology until desired properties or performance are obtained. The approach consists of ﬁnding the distribution of different material phases in a periodic unit cell that optimizes the properties or performance characteristics of the resulting composite system (Cherkaev and Kohn 1997; Cherkaev 2000). In the process of designing materials with prescribed and improved properties, a natural question related to the achievable properties in the material design process arises. Based on the fact that the constitutive elasticity matrix must be positive deﬁnite for elastic materials, Milton and Cherkaev (1995) have shown the existence

of materials for thermodynamically admissible sets by layering and combining an inﬁnitely rigid material with voids (inﬁnite compliance). However, the extreme condition of this admissible set, such as isotropic material with Poisson’s ratio equal to −1 (ν = −1), cannot be reached in practice because an inﬁnitely rigid material does not exist. Other bounds were derived in the past. Considering materials with ﬁnite properties, we can cite, for example, the work of Hashin and Shtrikman (1963) for bounds of an isotropic mixture of classical materials using energy analyses, the work of Lipton and Northrup (1994) (among others) that deﬁned the bounds for orthotropic mixtures of isotropic materials, and the work of Cherkaev and Gibiansky (1993) that improved the classical Hashin and Shtrikman (1963) estimates of the effective properties for an isotropic mixture assembled from two isotropic elastic materials. Bounds for elasticity and conductivity properties of mixtures of two materials (not necessarily isotropic) were developed by Gibiansky and Torquato (1995) and Cherkaev and Gibiansky (1996). Attainable properties for piezoelectric materials were discussed by Smith (1992) considering the positive deﬁniteness of a tensor involving elastic, piezoelectric, and dielectric properties, however, no bounds were obtained. Gibiansky and Torquato (1999) also discussed optimal bounds for piezoelectric matrix laminate composites. However, the extremal properties that can be achievable by composite designs is limited, and has been explored mainly for elasticity and conductivity (Sigmund 2000; Cherkaev and Gibiansky 1993; Gibiansky and Sigmund 2000; Larsen et al. 1997). In the past few years, the material design concept based on topology optimization and homogenization has been applied to design elastic (Sigmund 1994, 1995; Neves et al. 2002; Diaz and Benard 2003; Guedes et al. 2003; Neves et al. 2000), thermoelastic (Sigmund and Torquato 1996, 1997; Chen et al. 2001; Torquato et al. 2003), piezoelectric (Silva et al. 1998, 1999a, b; Sigmund et al. 1998; Sigmund and Torquato 1999), phononic (Sigmund and Jensen 2003), and photonic (Cox and Dobson 1999, 2000) composite materials, among others. In addition, manufacturing techniques have also been studied to build such materials (Qi and Halloran 2004; Van Hoy et al. 1998; Crumm and Halloran 1998; Qi et al. 2004; Mazumder et al. 1999, 2000; Crumm et al. 2007). However, processing techniques have not been explored when material gradation is considered inside the unit cell, and have concentrated in the traditional (1–0) design (Qi et al. 2004; Mazumder et al. 2000). This paper explores the computational design of periodic

functionally graded microstructures. The manufacturing of such materials is beyond the scope of the present work and is a subject of future research. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a brief introduction about topology optimization for FGM structures is given. In Section 3, the theoretical formulation of homogenization for FGM composite materials is addressed. In Section 4, the formulation of the composite material design problem based on continuous topology optimization is presented, and in Section 5 the material model applied is described. The numerical implementation, including an applied gradient control for material gradation, is discussed in Section 6. The sensitivity analysis is brieﬂy described in Section 7. In Section 8, some representative results are presented to illustrate homogenization and material design concepts. The inﬂuence of FGM gradation in the design of extreme materials such as minimum shear stiffness and negative Poisson’s ratio materials is discussed. Finally, in Section 9, concluding remarks are provided.

2 Topology optimization A major concept in topology optimization is the extended design domain, which is a large ﬁxed domain that must contain the whole structure to be determined by the optimization procedure. The objective is to determine the holes and connectivities of the structure by adding and removing material in this domain. Because the extended domain is ﬁxed, the ﬁnite element model is not changed during the optimization process, which simpliﬁes the calculation of derivatives of functions deﬁned over the extended domain (Bendsøe and Kikuchi 1988; Allaire 2002). In the case of material design, the extended design domain is the unit cell domain. The discrete problem, where the amount of material at each element can assume only values equal to either one or zero (i.e. void or solid material, respectively), is an ill-posed problem. A typical way to seek a solution for topology optimization problems is to relax the problem by allowing the material to assume intermediate property values during the optimization procedure, which can be achieved by deﬁning a special material model (Cherkaev 2000; Allaire 2002; Kohn and Strang 1986a, b, c; Murat and Tartar 1985). Essentially, the material model approximates the material distribution by deﬁning a function of a continuous parameter (design variable) that determines the mixture of basic materials throughout the domain. In this sense, the relaxation yields a continuous material design problem that no longer involves a discernible connectivity. A topology solution can be obtained by applying penalization

coefﬁcients to the material model to recover the 0–1 design (and thus, a discernible connectivity), and some gradient control on material distribution, such as a ﬁlter or projection (Bendsøe and Sigmund 2003). It turns out that this relaxed problem is strongly related to the FGM design problem, which essentially seeks a continuous transition of material properties (Paulino and Silva 2005; Silva and Paulino 2004). Thus, while the 0–1 design problem (needs complexity control, such as ﬁlter) does not admit intermediate values of design variables, the FGM design problem admit solutions with intermediate values of the material ﬁeld. Early work on material design followed a traditional topology optimization formulation, where the design variables are deﬁned in a piecewise fashion in the discretized domain, which means that continuity of the material distribution is not realized between ﬁnite elements. However, considering that the topology optimization results in a smoothly graded material, a more natural way of representing the material distribution emerges by considering a continuous representation of material properties (Matsui and Terada 2004; Rahmatalla and Swan 2004), which is achieved by interpolating the properties inside the ﬁnite element using shape functions (Matsui and Terada 2004; Rahmatalla and Swan 2003; Guest et al. 2004). The concept of employing continuum interpolation of material distribution inside the ﬁnite element has been implemented to model FGMs, originating the so-called “graded ﬁnite element” (Kim and Paulino 2002) . Thus, nodal design variables are deﬁned rather than the usual element based design variables. The objective of the present work is to design FGM composites using the concept of the relaxed problem in continuum topology optimization. Thus, the design of elastic FGM composites to achieve desired properties is addressed. The problem is posed by minimizing the square difference between homogenized and desired properties. A continuum distribution of the design variable inside the ﬁnite element domain is considered allowing representation of a continuous material variation during the design process. Since we are interested in solutions with a continuous distribution of material, we allow for intermediate materials (no penalization). A material model based on the Hashin and Shtrikman bounds is employed to guarantee that the ﬁnal composite can be achieved by a mixture of basic materials used in the design. A gradient control constraint in the unit cell domain is implemented based on projection techniques (Guest et al. 2004; Carbonari et al. 2007). This gradient control capability permits to address the inﬂuence of FGM gradation in the design of extreme materials. It also avoids the problem of

3 Homogenization method Homogenization allows the calculation of the effective properties of a complex periodic composite material from its unit cell topology. It is a general method for calculating effective properties and has no limitations regarding volume fraction or shape of the composite constituents. The main assumptions are that the unit cell is periodic and that the scale of the composite part is much larger than the microstructure dimensions (Cherkaev and Kohn 1997; Allaire 2002; Guedes and Kikuchi 1990). This section addresses details of the theoretical and computational aspects of the homogenization method applied to FGM composites. Considering the standard homogenization procedure for elastic materials, the unit cell is deﬁned as Y = [0, Y1 ] × [0, Y2 ] × [0, Y3 ] and the elastic property function Dijkl is considered to be a Y-periodic function: D (x) = D(x, y); and y = x/ , D(x, y) = D(x, y+Y) (1)

The calculation of effective properties can become computationally efﬁcient by taking advantage of symmetry boundary conditions. An isotropic unit cell has symmetry relative to all axes; and an orthotropic unit cell has symmetry relative to either both axes or only one axis. In this case, we can take advantage of these properties to reduce the computational cost and to conduct the optimization and homogenization in only one part of the domain. However, the appropriate boundary conditions must be considered for the displacement characteristic function χ. For a 2D plane-strain case, Table 1 describes the boundary conditions that must be speciﬁed when only one fourth or half of the unit cell is considered (Silva et al. 1998), as described in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. For the half symmetry case, the actual conditions to be employed must be taken according to the type of symmetry (along x-axis as in Fig. 4 or along the y-axis).

4 Material design method The material design optimization problem consists of ﬁnding a distribution of material inside the unit cell that will achieve speciﬁed homogenized properties. This problem is also known as the inverse homogenization problem (Cherkaev 2000; Sigmund 1994; Bendsøe and Sigmund 2003). The optimization problem consists of minimizing a cost function related to the density distribution inside the unit cell subjected to equality constraints on the elastic properties. Thus, the optimization problem can be stated in continuous form as follows (Sigmund 1994, 1995):

Here emphasis is placed in 2D problems, thus the indices i, j, k, and l range from 1 to 2. The gradation control constraint is used to adjust the material gradation, which is a key point in this work. The gradation control constraint also improves aspects associated to mesh dependency and numerical instabilities of the Continuous Approximation of Material Distribution (CAMD) approach such as the “islands” phenomenon (Matsui and Terada 2004). The implementation of the gradation control constraint is described in the Subsection 6.3. achieve this, we will allow for intermediate materials (no penalization), and to guarantee that the ﬁnal composite can be achieved by a mixture of the chosen basic materials, a material model based on the Hashin and Shtrikman (H–S) bounds is employed (Hashin and Shtrikman 1963; Cherkaev and Gibiansky 1993; Bendsøe and Sigmund 2003). These bounds provide the range of effective properties achievable for a certain volume fraction of the mixture of two isotropic materials. Thus, considering the upper and lower limits of bulk modulus (K) and shear modulus (G) properties, the material model is deﬁned as (Bendsøe and Sigmund 2003): Km (ρ) = κ Kmax (ρ) + (1 − κ)Kmin (ρ) Gm (ρ) = κGmax (ρ) + (1 − κ)Gmin (ρ), 5 A material model This work is concerned with FGMs represented by the transition between two basic materials. The objective is to ﬁnd the optimal volume fraction of this mixture at each point of the domain, so that the FGM property gradation inside the unit cell can also be found. To

The basic materials of the mixture will be designated by the symbols (+) and (−). They have bulk and shear modulus equal to K+ , K− and G+ , G− , respectively, such that K+ > K− and G+ > G− . The values of Kmax , Kmin , Gmax , and Gmin are functions of those properties (Appendix A). For ρ equal to 0 the material is equal to material (−) and for ρ equal to 1 it is equal to material (+). The Young’s modulus (Em ) and Poisson’s ratio (ν m ) of the mixture can be written as a function of Km and Gm through the expressions: E (ρ) =

and nd is the number of nodes at each element (for example, four in the 2D case). This formulation allows a continuous distribution of material along the design domain instead of the traditional piecewise constant material distribution applied by previous formulations of topology optimization (Bendsøe and Sigmund 2003). 6.1 Homogenization The numerical implementation of homogenization is presented considering the CAMD concept. Equation (8) is solved using FEM. The unit cell is discretized by N ﬁnite elements, thus:

Regarding the capability of traditional micromechanical models to evaluate effective properties, Reiter et al. (1997) have investigated the Mori-Tanaka and Self-consistent models to estimate these properties. Their main conclusion is that these models can be applied to the regions where the inclusion and the matrix phases can be easily distinguished. For the transition region, these models may be valid depending on the ratio of phase properties. The use of traditional micromechanical models for FGMs has been questioned in the literature because the continuous transition of microstructure causes a nonuniform macroscopic distribution of properties. Thus traditional approaches have limitations, and the reader is referred to the technical literature in the subject (Pindera et al. 1995; Yin et al. 2004). The computational framework presented here is general, and thus other material models can easily replace the present one based on H-S bounds (which assumes that the FGM gradation law is smooth enough for its application).

come from (20), where the indices m and n can be 1 or 2, resulting in the combinations “11”, “22”, and “12” or “21”. All load cases must be solved by enforcing periodic boundary conditions in the unit cell for the displacements (see Fig. 2). The unit cell is made of an FGM material. The material properties change gradually inside the element domain, and thus, the material property must be kept inside of the integral during integration using the graded ﬁnite element concept (Kim and Paulino 2002) (see Fig. 6). An order 2 Gaussian rule in each direction is applied to calculate integrals (22) and (11) for computing the effective properties. Regarding the numerical solution of the matrix system (20), the total matrix bandwidth is spoiled due to enforcement of periodicity conditions. This increases the amount of memory storage necessary for the matrix. This problem can be avoided when the unit cell is symmetric. In this case, we consider the symmetry boundary conditions described in Table 1, instead of the periodicity conditions. The displacements at some point of the unit cell must be prescribed to overcome the non-unique solution of the problem, otherwise the FEM problem will be illposed. The choice of this point with prescribed values does not affect the homogenized coefﬁcients because only the derivatives of the characteristic functions are used in their computation.

where ρ I is the design variable (pseudo-density) that represents the fraction of material at each ﬁnite element node of the design domain (see Fig. 7). There are N DV design variables, N DV being equal to the total number of ﬁnite elements N less the number of elements that are explicitly excluded from the optimization (N EXCL). If the basic isotropic material (−) is void (E− = 0) than a lower bound ρlow must be speciﬁed for design variables ρ I , to avoid numerical problems (singularity of the stiffness matrix in the ﬁnite element formulation). Numerically, regions with ρ I = ρlow , have practically no structural signiﬁcance and can be considered void regions. In this work, the value for ρlow is equal to 10−7 . Regarding the constraint related to the symmetry conditions, and considering the design domain a rectangular (2D problem) unit cell, we can deﬁne many kinds of symmetries relative to the symmetry axes of the rectangular domain. In this work, two symmetry axes are considered to reduce the computational cost as only one-quarter of the unit cell is used as a design domain. The symmetry conditions are

implicitly expressed in the boundary conditions during the homogenization, as described in Section 3. A ﬂow-chart of the optimization algorithm is shown in Fig. 8. The design variables are the pseudo-densities, which can assume different values at each ﬁnite element node. Four node bilinear isoparametric elements considering plane stress formulation are used in the ﬁnite element formulation (e.g. Kim and Paulino 2002). The optimization problem is solved by using the MMA algorithm which handles a relatively large number of design variables (Svanberg 1987; Bruyneel et al. 2002). The algorithm requires the sensitivities which are derived in Section 7. The iteration must start with a random initial guess of ρ I distribution. The initial values for the design variables cannot be uniform (homogeneous material) because they would generate equal values of gradients in relation to all design variables, and thus, the optimization method would not have a preferential direction for starting the search. As expected, the problem is highly dependent on the initial guess (Sigmund 1994, 1995; Sigmund and Torquato 1997). 6.3 Material gradation control The CAMD approach ensures a continuous material distribution across elements. However, it does not provide a general control of the gradient of material distribution. To achieve a mesh-independent control of the gradient of material distribution, we introduce a new layer of design variables and use a projection function to obtain the material densities at nodes. The use of nodal design variables and projection functions (Guest et al. 2004) will be applied on top of the CAMD in this paper (Carbonari et al. 2007). Let dn denote all design variables associated with nodes, and ρn , all values of material density at nodes. Assume that the required change of material density must occur over a minimum length of rmin . By means of the projection function ( f ), ρn can be obtained from dn as follows (assuming that four-node element is used) ρn = f (dn ) , where f is the projection function ρi = f d j =

and Si is the set of nodes in the domain under inﬂuence of node i, which consists of a circle of radius rmin and center at node i. The weight function w is deﬁned as follows. w rij =

7 Sensitivity analysis To solve the optimization problem deﬁned above, it is necessary to calculate the sensitivity of objective function and constraints in relation to the design variables. The sensitivities of the homogenized properties are well-known in the literature (Sigmund 1994, 1995), however, here the formulation is described considering the CAMD concept. Differentiating (11) in relation to the design variable and considering (8), after some algebraic manipulation, we get (Sigmund 1994; Sigmund and Torquato 1997): ∂D H 1 = |Y| ∂ρ I I + ∂ y χ x, y

8 Results To illustrate the theoretical and numerical approaches, numerical examples are provided. The homogenization method is veriﬁed by considering one-dimensional material gradation proﬁles for which analytical solutions for the effective elastic properties are available. The veriﬁcation of the homogenization method is also extended to two dimensions considering a trigonometric material gradation, and a material variation with discontinuous derivatives. These are also used as benchmark examples to verify the optimization method for FGM cell design. Finally the inﬂuence of material gradation on extreme materials is investigated, which includes materials with near-zero shear modulus, and materials with negative Poisson’s ratio. The examples provided are listed below: • • Veriﬁcation of homogenization for one-dimensional gradation Homogenization of two-dimensional FGM unit cells 1. 2. • Trigonometric material gradation Material with discontinuous derivatives

pseudo-density (ρ) and the properties at each point of the domain are obtained using the H-S bounds (see Appendix A). The (idealized) gradation is given by ρ (x) = (cos 2π x + 1) /2 and 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, (37)

with E+ = 8, ν + = 0.3, and E− = 1, ν − = 0.3. From reference (Bendsøe and Sigmund 2003), the effective elastic properties for this type of composite can be obtained by solving the analytical expressions:

8.2 Homogenization of FGM unit cells To illustrate the potentiality of the method, some twodimensional (2-D) FGM composite unit cells (Y = [0, 1] × [0, 1]) with two-dimensional gradation were homogenized. The same homogenized properties were used as input for the material design problem in Section 4 to check its capability to recover the material distribution. 8.2.1 Example 1 – trigonometric material gradation The ﬁrst gradation law considered (for the pseudodensity) is given by: ρ (x, y) = (sin 2π x sin 2π y + 1) /2 and 0 ≤ x ≤ 1; 0 ≤ y ≤ 1. as shown in Fig. 11a.

8.3 Optimized FGM cell design 8.3.1 Example 1—trigonometric material gradation Material design examples, using the implemented software, are presented. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, a square design domain with four symmetry axes (horizontal, vertical, and both diagonals) is adopted (see Fig. 3). The symmetry ensures that the obtained composite material will be orthotropic with equal values for properties D11 and D22 . The same property values for the basic materials (+) and (−), adopted in Section 8.2, are used here. The coefﬁcients w11 , w22 , w12 , and w33 adopted for the objective function in problem (23) are equal to 1, 1, 5, and 15, respectively. These values were chosen after some numerical experiments. A large value was chosen for the shear coefﬁcient because it is the most difﬁcult one to match in the problem (13). In traditional material design for composites, some discussion about the inﬂuence of weight coefﬁcients can be found in references (Sigmund 2000; Gibiansky and Sigmund 2000). The ﬁrst material design example consists of trying to recover the unit cell pattern presented in Example 1 of Section 8.2. Thus, the effective properties in (42) are speciﬁed as desired properties in the objective function of problem (23). The unit cell design domain is discretized into 20 × 20 ﬁnite elements. Initially, the gradient control with rmin equal to 0.318 was applied. This value is based on the pseudo-density distribution of (41). Figure 14a and b show the obtained pseudodensity distribution in the unit cell and the corresponding composite material matrix. The following property values were obtained from the optimization problem: ⎡ ⎤ 2.7147 0.9192 0 D H = ⎣ 0.9192 2.7147 0 ⎦. (45) 0 0 1.0262 which are similar to the ones in expression (42).

Notice that the recovered pattern shown in Fig. 14b is similar to the original one shown in Fig. 12b. Quantitavely, the averaged volume fraction ( ) of the recovered pattern for material (+) is equal to 0.5, exactly the same value for the original pattern. If no gradient control is used, the results shown in Figs. 15a and b are obtained, which are different from the original pattern shown in Fig. 12a and b, and the following property values are obtained: ⎤ 2.7147 0.9173 0 D H = ⎣ 0.9173 2.7147 0 ⎦. 0 0 1.0267 ⎡

(47) 0 0 1.3204 which are similar to the ones in expression (44). In the original pattern, the material gradation derivatives are not continuous. Thus, by using gradient control we cannot expect to recover the same pattern as shown in Fig. 13a and b. However, the method provides the best solution close to the desired one in the minimum square sense. Quantitatively, the averaged

These results are similar to the ones in expressions (42) and (45). However, in this case, the averaged volume fraction of the recovered pattern is equal to 0.483, which is different from the original pattern. This example shows that the use of gradient control is quite signiﬁcant for designing FGM microstructures.

8.3.2 Example 2—material with discontinuous derivatives This example consists of recovering the unit cell pattern of Example 2 presented in Section 8.2. Thus, the effective properties in (44) are speciﬁed as desired properties in the objective function of problem (23). The same design domain as the previous example is adopted. Initially, the gradient control with rmin equal to 0.5 was applied. Figure 16a and b show the pseudo-density

volume fraction of the recovered pattern for material (+) is equal to 0.658, while for the original pattern is 0.666. If no gradient control is used, the results in Fig. 17a and b are obtained, which are different from the original pattern shown in Fig. 13a and b, however, it recovers the property values ( (44) and (47)): ⎡ ⎤ 4.045 1.1510 0 D H = ⎣ 1.1510 4.045 0 ⎦. (48) 0 0 1.2951 The average volume fraction of the recovered pattern is equal to 0.649, which is different from the original pattern (0.666). As expected, the FGM gradation imposes

additional constraints in the material design process, which means that not all property values that could be feasible in a unit cell design without this constraint, can be obtained.

8.3.3 Example 3—near zero shear modulus The objective of this example is to analyze the inﬂuence of FGM gradation in the design of extreme materials. It is known that extreme materials can only be obtained with solid-void (0–1) designs and steep material variation (Sigmund 2000). However, usually, some gradation is obtained in the manufacturing processes of such materials. Thus, the question is how this gradation inﬂuences the behavior of a designed extreme material. To illustrate this point, we consider the design of materials with zero shear modulus and negative Poisson’s ratio. First, the design of a material with zero shear modulus is considered. Such material consists essentially of a mechanism, thus in the case of material design there will be always a minimum value for the shear modulus.

For the 0–1 problem a Poisson’s ratio close to −1 could not be obtained. The reason is that the method did not allow for ﬂexible hinges, thus, the lower value for the Poisson’s ratio that could be obtained was −0.6732 . The plot of the Poisson’s ratio value as a func-

This work shows that the material design method based on the continuum topology optimization together with a gradient control technique is applicable to the design of FGM microstructures. The continuous material distribution leads to a natural representation of the change of material properties inside the design domain in a continuous fashion, which is closely related to the FGM concept. The gradient control introduces a length scale in the process, which allows local control of the FGM gradation, and thus leads to feasible results. As expected, in the case of extreme materials, the presence of gradation moves the property values far from the extreme material property values. After a certain gradation control magnitude, the material behavior does not seem to be affected signiﬁcantly. The present work offers room for further extensions such as exploring graded three-dimensional architectures. Moreover, as indicated in the introduction, the present simulation framework can be used in conjunction with manufacturing techniques to achieve composites with locally graded microstructures. We notice that the resulting architecture has an additional

length scale associated with the material gradation. This poses a challenge for material processing, but also offers opportunities for developing new material microstructures with tailored functionality. In addition, the material design methodology adopted here can be used by material engineers who want to explore different microstructural architectures, including locally graded material systems. In fact, the development of novel techniques such as spark plasma sintering, coextrusion, selective laser melting, and solid free-form fabrication, e.g. 3D printing, may allow the fabrication of graded microstructures (e.g. printwise and layerwise) in conjunction with a computer model such as the one presented in this work.

Appendix A: H-S upper and lower limits For isotropic materials, the upper and lower limits of H-S are given as a function of the bulk modulus (K) and shear modulus (G). Thus, considering two isotropic materials indicated by superscripts (+) and (−), whose properties follow the relation K+ > K− and G+ > G− , the upper and lower limits for the bulk modulus, Kmax and Kmin , respectively, are given by (Hashin and Shtrikman 1963; Bendsøe and Sigmund 2003): (1 − ρ) ρ K+ − K− Kmax = (1−ρ) K +ρ K − (1 − ρ) K+ + ρ K− + G+
