Abstract We consider the 9-node shell element referred to as the MITC9 shell element in plate bending solutions and present a simpliﬁed mathematical analysis. The element uses bi-quadratic interpolations of the rotations and transverse displacement, and the “rotated Raviart-Thomas” interpolations for the transverse shear stresses. A rigorous mathematical analysis of the element is still lacking, even for the simpliﬁed case of plate solutions (that is, ﬂat shells), although the numerical evidence suggests a good and reliable behavior. Here we start such an analysis by considering a very simple particular case; namely, a rectangular plate, clamped all around the boundary, and solved with a uniform decomposition. Moreover, we consider only the so-called limit case, corresponding to the limit equations that are obtained for the thickness t going to zero. While the mathematical analysis of the limit case is simpler, such analysis, in general, gives an excellent indication of whether shear locking is present in

the real case t > 0. We detail that the element in the setting considered shows indeed optimal behavior. Keywords Plate · Shell · Shear locking · MITC9 shell element · Convergence analysis 1 Introduction Numerous ﬁnite elements based on Kirchhoff plate theory and Reissner–Mindlin plate theory have been proposed for linear plate analyses, see for example [1,2]. Today, plate bending elements are available that have been proven to be optimal by mathematical analysis and have revealed that optimal behavior also in numerical solutions, see e.g. [3–6]. Although these elements are available, of course, there is still important research in the analysis of plates to establish computationally more cost-effective schemes in general, and in particular for composite plate analyses where threedimensional effects can be important. The situation is quite different in the analysis of shells [7,8]. Such structures are much more difﬁcult to analyze and efﬁcient, reliable, and generally applicable shell elements are much more difﬁcult to develop. Indeed, while many shell elements have been proposed, there is still no element available that has been proven mathematically to always perform optimally in all shell analyses and in any mesh used. The reason is that the behavior of shell structures is greatly affected by the curvature of the shell, the boundary conditions, the thickness, and the loading applied [7–10]. Moreover, the limit behaviour of a shell for the thickness going to zero can show, even in quite realistic cases, a discouraging variety of patterns that make a uniﬁed analysis extremely difﬁcult, see e.g. [8–15]. While complete convergence proofs are very difﬁcult to achieve, and indeed still out of reach, it is important to recognize that mathematical analysis has been extremely valuable

to establish discriminating numerical tests with error norms to identify the value of a shell solution scheme [8,16,17]. A simple shell in bending is of course a ﬂat plate, and in practical ﬁnite element analyses it is common practice to use shell elements for plate solutions [1,2,18–20]. There are at least two reasons. First, in practice, plates are frequently encountered in complex structures, like in facetted conﬁgurations, with beams to act as stiffeners, or with attached cables (e.g. in a suspension bridge). In these cases, the membrane in-plane actions, like in a general shell, are very important. Second, if an originally ﬂat plate undergoes large displacements, a full shell behavior is encountered. Hence, if an originally ﬂat thin structure has been modeled using shell elements, a large displacement analysis can directly be pursued with the same ﬁnite element model. Therefore, ideally, we would have general shell elements that for plate bending analyses show optimal behavior, just like the optimal plate elements referred to above. Based on these thoughts, the quadratic MITC shell elements were tested for their behavior in plate analyses [21]. Specifically, the numerical performance of the MITC shell elements, developed for general shell analyses, was compared with the performance of the MITC plate elements, designed for the linear analysis of plates and known to yield optimal solutions. An interesting conclusion was that the MITC9 shell element of Ref. [22], based on the earlier element given in Ref. [23], performed as well as the MITC9 plate element of Refs. [3,5]. We show these results in Figs. 1 and 2. However, whereas the plate element has a strong mathematical foundation, the shell element was proposed based only on physical insight, mathematical conditions, and numerical experiments. A mathematical analysis of this element in complex shell analyses was out of reach. Clearly, a general mathematical analysis of the MITC9 shell element would be extremely valuable. However, it is already an important step to mathematically analyze the element when considering plate bending solutions only and focusing on the possibility of shear locking. Our objective in this paper is to detail such an analysis. We use a simpliﬁed setting to focus on the basic behavior of the element. The

mathematical analysis shows that the convergence of the element is indeed optimal—hence, that the numerical results in Ref. [21] should be expected. The given analysis and results are valuable because the mathematical proofs give strength to the numerical ﬁndings, and the analysis yields insight that may provide a basis for more comprehensive mathematical studies of the element, also directed to the solution of complex shell structures. In the paper, we will use the notation A B whenever there exists a constant C, depending only on the ratio of the

two edges of the rectangular domain, such that A ≤ C B. Clearly A B will be used whenever B A. Throughout the paper, for s an integer we will denote by H s ( ) the usual Sobolev space of functions that are squareintegrable in together with their (weak) derivatives up to s the order s. We denote by H0 ( ) the subspace of H s ( ) made of functions that vanish at the boundary ∂ of together with all their derivatives up to the order s − 1. Moreover · s, or simply · s will be used to indicate the usual Sobolev norm in H s ( ) (or copies of it). In particular we shall use the notation · 0 and (· , ·)0 for the norm and the scalar product (respectively) in L 2 ( ) or copies of it.

Proposition 2.1 The bilinear form At is continuous and elliptic on U × U for every t > 0, in the sense that: for every t with 0 < t < L 1 there exist three positive constants Ct , Cb and Cs such that At (U, V ) ≤ Ct U U V U Ab (U, V ) ≤ Cb U U V U At (V, V ) ≥ Cs V U

Moreover Cb and Cs are independent of t. Proof The continuity properties (2.7) and (2.8) are obvious. Next, we recall the Korn inequality: for V = (η, v) ∈ U Ab (V, V ) ≡ (ε(η), ε(η))0 η

2 Formulation of the problem and basic notation which implies In this section we formulate the continuous problem and introduce some required notation for our analysis. 2.1 The continuous problem Let be the rectangle ]0, L 1 [×]0, L 2 [. Without loss of generality we can assume that L 1 ≤ L 2 . Introducing the spaces

and the property in (2.9) follows from (2.11) and (2.12). Remark 2.2 For simplicity we assumed in (2.5) Poisson’s ratio equal to 0. However, it is clear that the properties of At and Ab in the above proposition (which we use for all our estimates) also hold if the bilinear forms include the effects of nonzero Poisson’s ratio. We now ﬁx a function (load) g ∈ L 2 ( ) and deﬁne

(2.1)

corresponding to hard clamped boundary conditions (see, e.g., [1]), we set U := ×W (2.2)

We also deﬁne, for η ∈ (ε(η))i, j := 1 2

V U.

(2.14)

We then consider the problem: Find U ∈ U such that At (U, V ) = (G, V )0 ∀V ∈ U. (2.15)

and for every t > 0 we deﬁne the bilinear form At on U × U, with Young’s modulus equal to 12 and Poisson’s ratio equal to 0, as [24] At (U, V ) := (ε(θ), ε(η))0 + 6t −2 (∇w − θ , ∇v − η)0 (2.5) for U = (θ , w) and V = (η, v). We are interested in the case “t small”. Hence, even when it is not explicitly speciﬁed, we will always consider the case of t being small, certainly t < L 1. The bending part of the bilinear form At will be usually denoted by Ab , that is Ab (U, V ) := (ε(θ), ε(η))0 . (2.6)

From Proposition 2.1 we have immediately existence and uniqueness of the solution of (2.15). Proposition 2.3 For every t > 0 and for every g ∈ L 2 ( ) problem (2.15) has a unique solution U that satisﬁes U U g 0. (2.16)

Moreover, U coincides with the unique minimizer on U of the functional JtR M (V ) := 1 At (V, V ) − (G, V )0 . 2 (2.17)

We recall the following well known result (see, e.g., [4,8]).

2.2 The Lagrange multipliers formulation We introduce now the formulation with multipliers. For this we need to deﬁne the spaces H (rot; ) := {δ ∈ (L 2 ( ))2 , such that rotδ ∈ L 2 ( )}, (2.18) where rotδ, as usual in two-dimensional settings, is deﬁned ∂δ ∂δ as rotδ := ∂ x2 − ∂ x1 , and 1 2 Q := H0 (rot; ) ≡ {δ ∈ H (rot; ) such that, δ · t = 0 on ∂ } (2.19) where t is the unit counterclockwise tangent vector to ∂ . We also deﬁne the norm δ
2 Q

As Proposition 2.5 implies the inf-sup condition ∃β > 0 such that inf sup
Q μ∈M V ∈U

B(V ), μ M ≥β V U μ M

(2.27)

we can easily have the following result [4,25]. Proposition 2.6 For every t > 0 and for every g ∈ L 2 ( ), problem (2.26) has a unique solution (U, λ) that satisﬁes U U+ λ M g 0. (2.28) Moreover, U coincides with the solution of (2.15). Proof The result is rather classical, but we summarize the proof for the convenience of the reader. Let us ﬁrst consider, for every t > 0, the solution U of (2.15), and set λ := 6t −2 B(U ) that belongs to Q ⊂ L. It is easy to see that the pair (U, λ) is a solution of (2.26). Moreover the ﬁrst part of (2.28), that is U U g 0, (2.29)

(2.20)

We can also deﬁne the space of multipliers M as M := Q (2.21)

(that is, the dual space of Q). We shall often use the following notation L := L 2 ( )

holds true due to (2.16). Finally, from (2.27) we immediately have that 1 Q B(V ∗ ), λ M , (2.30) ∃ V ∗ ∈ U such that λ M ≤ β V∗ U and using the ﬁrst equation of (2.26) with V = V ∗ , and then (2.14) and (2.8), we have 1 (G, V ∗ )0 −Ab (U, V ∗ ) λ M≤ ( g 0 + U U ), β V∗ U (2.31)

(2.22)

It is evident that Q ⊆ L with continuous dense embedding so that L (that we identify as usual with its own dual space) can be identiﬁed with a dense subspace of M = Q . Remark 2.4 It can be proved (see, e.g., [4]) that M ≡ {μ ∈ (H −1 ( ))2 such that divμ ∈ H −1 ( )}. (2.23)

and the result follows from (2.29) and (2.31). Remark 2.7 In mathematical terms, problem (2.26) is singularly perturbed, since, for a general G ∈ U and a general Lipschitz domain, its solution (U (t), λ(t)) exists in U × L for every t > 0, but is not uniformly bounded in U × L. However, U (t) is uniformly bounded in U, and the inf-sup condition (2.27) provides a uniform bound for λ(t) in M (although not in L). 2.3 The limit problem As the bound in (2.28) does not depend on t (and U and M are Hilbert spaces), it is easy to see and well known (see e.g. [4], Theorem VII.3.1) that U = U (t) and λ = λ(t) have a limit for t → 0. Proposition 2.8 For every g ∈ L 2 ( ) we have lim (U (t), λ(t)) = (U0 , λ0 )

It will also be convenient to introduce the operator B : U → Q deﬁned as B(V ) = ∇v − η for V = (η, v). (2.24)

The following result is well known (see e.g. [4]). Proposition 2.5 The space Q coincides with the image of U through the operator B. Moreover, for every δ ∈ Q there exists a V ∈ U such that B(V ) = δ and V U δ
Q.

Moreover, θ 0 = ∇w0 and w0 is the solution of the (Kirchhoff-like) problem ∂w0 2 = 0 on ∂ . (2.34) w0 = g in , w0 = 0 and ∂n It is immediate to see that, introducing the linear space Z = {V = (v, η) ∈ U such that η = ∇v}, problem (2.33) is equivalent to Find U0 ∈ Z such that Ab (U0 , V ) = (G, V )0 ∀ V ∈ Z (2.36) (2.35)

in the sense that: if (U0 , λ0 ) solves (2.33) then U0 solves (2.36). We shall focus on this limit problem in our convergence analysis of the MITC9 shell element. This analysis is tractable and will give a strong indication on whether the element is shear-locking or not when solving this problem using the speciﬁed uniform decompositions. Figures 3 and 4 give the proﬁles of the transverse displacement of the plate along its midline, as calculated using

the MITC4 shell element—which is in this solution identical to the MITC4 plate element and known to be lockingfree [24]—and the 4-node displacement-based element— which is known to severely lock. We see that for the MITC4 shell element, the displacements are indistinguishable for the coarse and ﬁne meshes used when t/L = 1/100 and smaller. Shear deformations contribute to the response when the plate is thick. On the other hand, for the displacementbased element, the displacements become rapidly small when the thickness of the plate decreases, that is, the element locks. These numerical results, together with those of Fig. 2, illustrate that—as expected—in a mathematical analysis it is reasonable to consider the limit problem as a valuable indicator of the performances of an element for thin and moderately thick plates.

Here we h want to study the error U0 − U0 U . We start with the following “abstract” result. Theorem 3.3 Let (U0 , λ0 ) be the solution of (2.33), and let h U0 be the solution of (3.12).

Remark 3.1 The corresponding MITC9 plate element uses the same space h as in (3.3), while Wh consists of local 8-node serendipity functions. The space M is more sophisticated: the ﬁrst component is made of local P2 polynomials without the monomial x 2 , while the second component is made of local P2 polynomials without the monomial y 2 [6]. The analysis (see e.g. [26]) is largely based on the properties of the Q2 −P1 Stokes element. The operator uses, for each component, the average over the element domain instead of the two internal stations shown in Fig. 6. Remark 3.2 We should note that the bending part in (3.10) is not reduced, like also for the MITC9 plate element. In the MITC9 shell element the membrane and the bending strains are actually reduced in order to circumvent membrane locking. However, this reduction does not affect possible shear locking and the convergence rate of the element in the plate solutions considered here.

Indeed, by Simpson’s integration formula on each edge, exact for polynomials of degree ≤ 3 we deduce (w − w I )ds = 0 on each edge e of K .

4 Error estimates for the limit problem Here we want to apply the general result of Theorem 3.3 to our speciﬁc discretization. To this purpose we need an estimate for the two pieces appearing on the right-hand side of (3.13). We start with the ﬁrst one. Theorem 4.1 Let (U0 , λ0 ) ≡ ((θ 0 , w0 ), λ0 ) be the solution of (2.33). Then there exist θ I ∈ h and w I ∈ W h such that ||θ 0 − θ I ||1, ≤ C h 2 ||w0 ||4, , ||w0 − w I ||1, ≤ C h 2 ||w0 ||3, , θ = ∇w .

By applying the tensor-product Simpson rule we also deduce (w − w I )d xd y = 0 ∀K .
K

We deﬁne now θ I ∈ h as the continuous interpolant of ∇ w deﬁned as in (4.6), that is,
I I θ1 = wx , θ2 = w y at the 9 nodes.

(4.1) (4.2) (4.3)

(4.10)

From (4.5) and (4.7) we deduce ||θ 0 −θ I ||1, = ||∇(w0 − w)+∇ w−θ I ||1, ≤ C h 2 |w0 |4, . (4.11) In order to prove (4.3), let K ≡ (xi , xi+1 ) × (y j , y j+1 ) be an element of Th , let e(x, y j ) := w(x, y j ) − w I (x, y j ), and let p1 (x) be any polynomial of degree ≤ 1. Using (4.6) and (4.9) we easily have that e(x, y j ) vanishes at the endpoints and it has zero mean value on (xi , xi+1 ). Hence, integrating by parts,
xi+1 xi+1

Proof We follow techniques similar to those used in [27]. Deﬁne ﬁrst w as the Bogner–Fox–Schmit approximation of w0 deﬁned locally by: w ∈ C 1( ) : w|K ∈ Q3 (K ) ∀K , (4.4) w = w0 , wx = (w0 )x , w y = (w0 ) y , wx y = (w0 )x y at the vertices of each K , and recall that, on each K , |w − w0 |s,K ≤ C h r −s |w0 |r,K , 0 ≤ s ≤ r ≤ 4. (4.5) Next, let w I ∈ Wh be the classical 9-nodes continuous interpolant of w, deﬁned locally by w I ∈ Q2 (K ) ∀K , w I = w at the four vertices of each element K , w I = w at the midpoints of each edge e of K , ∀K , w I = w at the barycenter of each element K , for which the following estimate holds |w − w I |s,K ≤ C h r −s |w|r,K ≤ C h r −s |w0 |r,K , 0≤s ≤r ≤3 (4.7) for all K . Setting w I = w I , from (4.5) and (4.7) we have then in particular w0 −w I

It follows then that ex (x, y j ) is a Legendre polynomial of degree 2. As such, it vanishes at the 2 Gauss points xi 1 , xi 2 of (xi , xi+1 ). Hence,
I I wx (xi 1 , y j ) = wx (xi 1 , y j ), wx (xi 2 , y j ) = wx (xi 2 , y j ).

(4.12) We further remark that on the horizontal line y = y j we have I that θ1 and wx are each a polynomial of degree 2. Using (4.10) we see that they coincide at three points, and hence they coincide on the whole line. Hence we might rewrite (4.12) as
I I I I θ1 (xi 1 , y j ) = wx (xi 1 , y j ), θ1 (xi 2 , y j ) = wx (xi 2 , y j ).

We notice that an alternative, equivalent definition of (4.6) is: w I ∈ Q2 (K ) ∀K , w I = w at the four vertices of each element K , (w − w I )ds = 0 on each edge e of K , ∀K ,

Remark 4.2 The construction of θ I and w I (crucial for establishing the ﬁnal estimates) could have been made also by more traditional techniques (i.e., through the “Stokes + Raviart-Thomas” approach). This however would have required the use of the Q2 −Q1 Stokes element. The analysis of this element is not simple, and in general requires restrictions on the geometry of the elements (see [28]). Therefore we prefer the present construction because the extension to more general situations seems to have more possibilities. In order to estimate the second piece of the right-hand side of (3.13) we make ﬁrst two crucial observations. The ﬁrst one, quite obvious, is that coincides with the identity operator when applied to constant vectors. For every η ∈ h we can then denote by η its piecewise L 2 projection on constant vectors, and adding and subtracting η ≡ η, and using (3.9) and usual approximation results we have η− η
0

Hence, introducing λ0 as the piecewise constant mean value of λ0 , using (4.16) and Cauchy–Schwarz, and then usual approximation results and (4.15) we have λ0 (η − η) dx dy

Collecting the result of Theorem 3.3 together with the results of Theorems 4.1 and 4.3 we now have the ﬁnal result. Theorem 4.4 Let (U0 , λ0 ) ≡ ((w0 , θ 0 ), λ0 ) be the solution h of (2.33), and let U0 be the solution of (3.12). Then we have
h U0 − U0 U

(4.15)

The second observation is that for every η ∈ h and for every K ∈ Th the ﬁrst component η1 is a polynomial in Q2 while ( η)1 is a polynomial of Q1,2 that coincides with η1 at the two Legendre points of the horizontal lines y = y j , y = y j+1 and y = y m . Hence, on each of the vertical lines j x = xi 1 and x = xi 2 the two polynomials η1 and ( η)1 (as polynomials of degree two that coincide at three different points) coincide on the whole line. Consequently, by applying two-point Gauss integration in x, and Simpson’s rule in y, we immediately see that

Therefore the element should behave optimally in the numerical plate solution considered in Fig. 1 and this is indeed the case as shown in Fig. 2.

5 Concluding remarks Our objective in this paper was to give a mathematical analysis of the MITC9 shell element when used in plate bending solutions. Shell elements are used in general to model plate structures in engineering and the sciences; hence the analysis pursued herein is of considerable interest. While we considered a simpliﬁed setting, namely a clamped plate problem solved using uniform meshes and the limit problem with plate thickness equal to zero, the analysis is valuable because it gives insight into the behavior of the element. The mathematical convergence analysis given in the paper shows that in this simple setting the element behaves optimally for displacements and rotations and hence does not lock. Some numerical results given in the paper also illustrate that it is reasonable to consider the case of vanishing plate thickness for the mathematical analysis. Considering future work, since we used in all our analyses uniform meshes, it would be of value to also study the performance of the element in non-uniform decompositions, as well as the case of positive thickness. Furthermore, a more general mathematical convergence analysis of the MITC9 shell element when used for the solution of actual shell problems, that is, involving curved thin structures, would be very valuable.

We can now easily estimate the second term of (3.13). Theorem 4.3 Let (U0 , λ0 ) ≡ ((θ 0 , w0 ), λ0 ) be the solution of (2.33). Then for every V h = (v, η) ∈ U h we have |(λ0 , B(V h ) − (B(V h )))0 | h 2 λ0

(4.17)

Proof We begin by recalling that from (2.24) we have B(V h ) = ∇v − η, and from (3.8) we have (∇v) = ∇v, so that B(V h ) − (B(V h )) = −η + (η). (4.18)
