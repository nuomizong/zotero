In this paper, we investigate the static and dynamic modal behavior of the MITC3+ triangular shell element (Lee and Bathe, 2004; Lee et al., 2014). We focus on bending-dominated situations because such shell problems are particularly difï¬cult to solve when using low-order elements. For comparison, the pure displacement-based (DISP3), MITC3 and MITC4 shell elements are also studied. First, static mode solutions are performed for a single right-angled shell element and an assemblage of two right-angled shell elements. The detailed strain ï¬elds are established in the bending modes. This study provides insight into how shear locking occurs on the mode level. We then analytically show how the MITC3+ shell element properly represents the pure bending conditions in a two-sided clamped plate problem. Considering free plate and free hyperboloid shell problems, we ï¬nally present the excellent performance of the MITC3+ shell element in dynamic mode solutions. Ã 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

1. Introduction Shell structures are ubiquitous in various engineering and scientiï¬c ï¬elds. In the past decades, the ï¬nite element method has been dominantly used to analyze shell structures. In these analyses, it is crucial to use reliable and effective shell ï¬nite elements. However, due to the complex and highly sensitive behaviors of shells, it is challenging to develop shell ï¬nite elements and, indeed, a great challenge to reach ââidealââ (that is, optimal) elements [1â6]. In particular, it is important to obtain an ideal 3-node shell element. Due to its simple geometry deï¬ned by only three corner nodes, such an element can be very effectively used in the automatic mesh generation of complex shells. An ideal shell ï¬nite element should uniformly converge with optimal rate in all problems for all asymptotic behaviors (membrane dominated, bending dominated and mixed behaviors) irrespective of the shell geometry, boundary conditions and applied loadings [3â10]. Of course, the shell element should satisfy the ellipticity and consistency conditions. A main difï¬culty in shell ï¬nite element analysis is that the solution accuracy may become drastically worse as the shell thickness decreases. This phenomenon is called locking, which occurs when the element discretization of a shell structure cannot properly represent pure bending displacement ï¬elds [4].

To signiï¬cantly reduce the locking, the MITC method was developed and ï¬rst applied to develop a 4-node shell element, the MITC4 element [11,12]. Then the method was used to develop higher-order quadrilateral elements [13,14] and a 3-node triangular shell element, the MITC3 element, as well as higher-order triangular shell elements [1,15]. However, the performance of the MITC3 shell element is not as good as of the MITC4 shell element, even though the MITC3 shell element yields much more accurate solutions than the displacement-based 3-node shell element, the DISP3 element [16]. Recently, based on the concept of the MITC3 shell element, a new 3-node triangular MITC3+ shell ï¬nite element was developed [2]. The MITC3+ shell element uses a cubic bubble function for the interpolation of the rotations to enrich the bending displacement ï¬elds. The corresponding rotation degrees of freedom can be statically condensed out on the element level. A new assumed transverse shear strain ï¬eld was developed with a new tying scheme to alleviate shear locking while satisfying the consistency and ellipticity conditions. The MITC3+ shell element passes the three basic tests (the patch, zero energy mode and isotropy tests) and shows excellent convergence behaviors in various shell problems even when highly distorted meshes are used [2]. An excellent performance of the MITC3+ shell element in geometric nonlinear analysis was also measured [17]. With such encouraging results at hand, it is clearly of interest to further study this element and identify more deeply its fundamental features. Our objective in this paper is to present a deeper understanding of the MITC3+ shell element through detailed static and dynamic

mode solutions. The DISP3, MITC3 and MITC4 shell elements are also considered for comparisons. In the static mode solutions of a single right-angled triangular element and an assemblage of two right-angled triangular elements, we investigate the transverse shear strain ï¬elds in the bending modes. This study shows how the MITC3+ shell element performs on the mode level. The transverse shear strain ï¬elds of the MITC3+ shell element are also studied analytically in a two-sided clamped plate problem, to see whether and how locking occurs. In the dynamic mode solutions, the frequencies and mode shapes are evaluated considering a free square plate problem and a hyperboloid shell problem and the convergence of the frequencies is presented. In the following sections, we ï¬rst review the formulations of the 3-node triangular shell ï¬nite elements that we consider in this paper and then we present the results of our investigations. 2. Formulations of 3-node triangular shell elements In this section, the formulations of three 3-node continuum mechanics based triangular shell ï¬nite elements are brieï¬y reviewed: the DISP3, MITC3 and MITC3+ shell elements. 2.1.

The displacement-based 3-node shell ï¬nite element has no spurious zero energy mode and satisï¬es the isotropy condition. However, in bending-dominated problems, this shell ï¬nite element is extremely stiff due to shear locking [16]. 2.2. The MITC3 shell element The geometry and displacement interpolations are identical to the DISP3 shell element, but the MITC method is applied [1]. Since the geometry of the 3-node triangular shell ï¬nite element is ï¬at, the MITC method is only applied to construct the covariant transverse shear strain ï¬eld with constant covariant transverse shear strain conditions along the edges. The assumed transverse shear strain ï¬eld of the MITC3 shell element is given by [1]

where a4 and b4 are the rotation degrees of freedom at the internal node [2]. These additional rotation degrees of freedom can be condensed out on the element level. Unlike the standard 3-node shell elements, the MITC3+ shell element has an internal node and the corresponding cubic bubble function in the geometry and displacement interpolations. The internal node with only rotation degrees of freedom is positioned on the ï¬at surface deï¬ned by the three corner nodes of the element. Hence, the geometry of the MITC3+ shell element is

Using the above relations, we can study the detailed strain behavior of shell ï¬nite elements in each eigenvector mode. Since shell ï¬nite elements should produce zero transverse shear strains in the bending modes, important insight into shear locking of an element can be obtained when considering the eigenvectors.

bending modes B1, B2, and B3 shown in Fig. 6, the MITC3+ shell element has 2 additional anti-symmetric bending modes B1+ and B2+ shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b) due to the bubble function enrichment on rotations [18]. Note that the anti-symmetric bending modes B1+ and B2+ ââcorrespondââ to the symmetric bending modes B1 and B3, respectively. It is observed that, in the bending modes B1, B2 and B3, the eigenvalues of the DISP3 shell element are much larger than those of the MITC3 and MITC3+ shell elements. That is,

the DISP3 shell element is much stiffer. Another important observation is that the MITC3+ shell element contains a much more ï¬exible in-plane twisting mode T than the MITC3 shell element. We next investigate the transverse shearing behavior of the DISP3, MITC3 and MITC3+ shell elements on the deformation mode level. The bending modes B1, B2, B3, B1+ and B2+ are considered. Note that the transverse shear strains cxz and cyz should be zero in the bending modes. Table 3 summarizes the strain ï¬elds of the DISP3 and MITC3 shell elements obtained by Eq. (11) in the bending modes. Obviously, the DISP3 shell element produces non-zero transverse shear strains in all bending modes, that is, the element severely locks. However, the MITC3 shell element produces zero transverse shear strains in the bending modes B1, B2 and B3. Hence the shear locking is completely removed on the element level. A further analysis shows that the same observation holds for a single MITC3 triangular element of arbitrary shape. However, it is important to note that, nevertheless, the MITC3 shell element still shows shear locking on the element assemblage level, see the convergence test results in Refs. [1,2,16,19]. Of course, the locking is much less severe than for the DISP3 shell element. The MITC3+ shell element also gives zero transverse shears in the bending modes B1, B2 and B3. In addition, Table 4 presents the strain ï¬elds in the bending modes B1+ and B2+ and shows that in these bending modes, as well, zero transverse shear strains are seen.

We also investigate the strain ï¬elds of the MITC3+ shell element in the in-plane twisting mode T shown in Fig. 7(c). Table 4 shows that the transverse shear strains in the in-plane twisting mode depend on the tying distance d deï¬ned in Fig. 4(b) and Table 1. In Refs. [2,19], we observed that the performance of the 3-node shell element can be improved by reducing the transverse shear strains in the in-plane twisting mode. In the following section, we study how the in-plane twisting mode affects the modal behavior. 3.2. Assemblage of two right-angled triangular elements We consider an assemblage of two right-angled triangular shell elements with free boundary as shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b). The static mode solution is performed for the MITC3 and MITC3+ shell elements, and, for comparison, a single MITC4 shell element is also tested, see Fig. 8(c). We use a=L Â¼ 1=10; 000; E Â¼ 1:7472 Ã 107 and

m Â¼ 0:3.
Table 5 presents the eigenvalues of the stiffness matrices of the MITC4, MITC3 and MITC3+ models. The deformation modes are

named based on their kinematics (bending, in-plane twisting, transverse shearing, and membrane kinematics). All shell element models produce 6 bending modes BC1, BC2, BC3, BC4, BL1 and BL2, and the MITC3+ shell element additionally produces 4 bending modes BQ1+, BQ2+, BQ3+ and BQ4+ due to the bubble function enrichment on rotations. It is seen that, in the bending mode BL1 shown in Fig. 9, the MITC3 shell element shows a much stiffer behavior than the MITC4 and MITC3+ shell elements. Compared to the MITC3 shell element, the MITC3+ shell element is much more ï¬exible in the bending mode BL1 and in the in-plane twisting mode TQ. In Ref. [2], we observed that, for a single MITC3+ shell element, as the tying distance d decreases, the eigenvalue corresponding to the in-plane twisting mode T decreases and is zero when d Â¼ 0. Considering now the assemblage of the MITC3+ shell elements shown in Fig. 8(b), we also perform the eigenvalue test by varying the tying distance d. Table 6 presents the eigenvalues of the assemblage of the two MITC3+ shell elements. As the tying distance d decreases (that is, the eigenvalue of the in-plane twisting mode T of a single MITC3+ element becomes smaller), the eigenvalues corresponding to the bending mode BL1 and in-plane twisting mode TQ decrease together. This fact implies that the in-plane twisting acts together with the bending mode BL1. In Table 6, we also show that, unlike for a single MITC3+ shell element [2], a zero eigenvalue is not present when d Â¼ 0. The reason is graphically explained in Fig. 10, which shows that the in-plane twisting mode of an assemblage of two triangular shell elements cannot be activated like for a single triangular shell element [2,20]. Table 7 presents the strain ï¬elds for the MITC4, MITC3 and MITC3+ shell elements to investigate the shear locking behavior in the bending mode BL1. For the MITC4 shell element, the bending mode BL1 produces linear bending strain ï¬elds for exx ; eyy and cxy (that is, the strain ï¬elds are linear functions of r and sÃ and zero

transverse shear strains. The bending mode BL1 of the MITC3 shell elements produces constant bending strain ï¬elds and non-zero transverse shear strains, that is, shear locking occurs in the element assemblage. However, with the help of the bending mode B1+ of a single MITC3+ shell element, in the bending mode BL1, the MITC3+ shell element produces bending strain ï¬elds up to quadratic order for exx ; eyy and cxy and zero transverse shear strains when d Â¼ 0. Hence, in the bending mode BL1, shear locking can be alleviated with a small value of d and is completely removed with d Â¼ 0. In summary, for the MITC3+ element, an enriched bending strain ï¬eld is provided through the bending mode BL1 for the two element assemblage. The shear locking in this mode is alleviated by controlling the stiffness in the in-plane twisting mode T of a single MITC3+ shell element. This behavior is not present in the MITC3 shell element, which does not lock on the element level, but locks in the two element assemblage due to a deï¬ciency of pure bending modes.

The reference solutions are obtained by 50 Ã 50 element meshes of the MITC4 shell element.

4. Two-sided clamped plate problem In this section, we study the behavior of the MITC3+ shell element in the two-sided clamped plate of dimension L Ã L shown Fig. 11 (L Â¼ 1:0; E Â¼ 1:7472 Ã 107 and m Â¼ 0Ã. The plate is subjected to uniform moments ma and Ãmb along its free sides. The boundary conditions are u Â¼ v Â¼ w Â¼ a Â¼ b Â¼ 0 along the two clamped edges. This plate problem was used to investigate the shear locking behavior of 3-node triangular shell elements in Ref. [16], which reports that, while the MITC3 shell element does not lock in Mesh B, the shell element severely locks in Mesh A. In general, triangular shell elements show such stiff behavior in Mesh A due to shear locking. To improve the performance of 3-node triangular

shell elements, this phenomenon should be overcome. Hence, we investigate the effectiveness of the MITC3+ shell element in the analysis of this two-sided clamped plate problem. 4.1. Transverse shear strain ï¬elds Using the two MITC3+ shell elements, the two-sided clamped plate is modeled as shown by element-I and element-II in Fig. 12. The geometry of the elements is given by the following nodal positions
x1 Â¼ 1;y1 Â¼ 0; x2 Â¼ 1;y2 Â¼ 1; x3 Â¼ 0;y3 Â¼ 0; x4 Â¼ 2=3;y4 Â¼ 1=3 for element-I; x1 Â¼ 0;y1 Â¼ 1; x2 Â¼ 1;y2 Â¼ 1; x3 Â¼ 0;y3 Â¼ 0; x4 Â¼ 1=3;y4 Â¼ 2=3 for element-II; Ã°12Ã

No anticlastic curvature exists because Poissonâs ratio m Â¼ 0. If a triangular shell element does not show shear locking, Eqs. (14) and (15) should be satisï¬ed. For element-I, we derive the transverse shear strain ï¬eld in Appendix, see Eq. (A.3). Using the conditions given in Eqs. (12) and (13) with the symmetry condition a2 Â¼ Ãb2 , the transverse shear strain ï¬elds for the two elements are for element-I

This result shows that the MITC3+ shell element can correctly represent the pure bending conditions in Eqs. (14) and (15) when d Â¼ 0. Similarly, we tested the MITC3+ shell element in Mesh B and observed that the elements in Mesh B also satisfy the pure bending conditions. Of course, the MITC3 shell element does not satisfy the pure bending conditions in Mesh A and thus shear locking occurs [16]. 4.2. Strain energies Considering three different thicknesses (a=L Â¼ 1=100, 1/1,000 and 1/10,000), we next solve the two-sided clamped plate problem using the MITC3, MITC3+ and MITC4 shell elements with the applied moments ma Â¼ mb Â¼ 2=L, see Fig. 11.

element shows correct results only in Mesh B. The MITC3+ shell element shows correct behaviors in both Meshes A and B, although the solutions depend on the mesh patterns. The MITC4 shell element obviously shows excellent results. Changing the tying distance d in the assumed transverse shear strain ï¬eld of the MITC3+ shell element, we investigate the strain energy stored in the two-sided clamped plate problem with Mesh A. Four different tying distances are considered: d Â¼ 1=100; 1=1; 000; 1=10; 000 and 1/100,000. Table 9 shows that, as the distance d approaches zero, the behavior of the MITC3+ shell element become better. We note that the bending mode BL1 of the assemblage of two right-angled triangular elements is signiï¬cantly present in the pure bending displacement ï¬eld of the problem with Mesh A. Thus, the improved behavior of the MITC3+ shell element is directly due to the alleviation of shear locking in this mode.

5. Dynamic mode solutions In this section, we perform dynamic mode solutions to investigate the predictive capability of the MITC3 and MITC3+ shell elements in dynamic analysis. Frequencies and modes are calculated and the results are compared with those of the MITC4 shell element. We consider two benchmark problems: a free square plate problem and a free hyperboloid shell problem [1,2,21â27]. For dynamic mode solutions, the following eigenvalue problem is solved

Fig. 16. Table 13 presents the frequencies with distorted 4N Ã 2N element meshes (N Â¼ 5, 10, 15 and 20) when a=L Â¼ 1=1; 000. Fig. 21 shows the convergence curves of the 7th and 8th frequencies. In both results, we observe that, while the MITC4 and MITC3 shell elements lock, the MITC3+ shell element still shows good results. 6. Concluding remarks In this paper, we presented new insight into the static and dynamic modal behaviors of the MITC3+ triangular shell element. For comparison, also the DISP3, MITC3 and MITC4 shell elements were considered. Detailed static mode solutions were studied for the single right-angled triangular shell elements and the assemblage of two right-angled triangular shell elements. We also investigated the transverse shear strain ï¬elds of the MITC3+ shell element in the two-sided clamped plate problem. Through these studies, we found that the MITC3+ shell element formulation contains additional anti-symmetric bending modes (B1+ and B2+) due to the bubble function enrichment, and shear locking is alleviated in these modes using the MITC method. Consequently, unlike the DISP3 and MITC3 shell elements, the MITC3+ shell element performed well in the solution of all cases. We also performed dynamic mode solutions of an unsupported square plate and a free hyperboloid shell, both representing bending-dominated problems in which locking would be seen, if present. We observed that the MITC3+ shell element shows much better convergence behaviors than the MITC3 shell element. Indeed, the MITC3+ shell element gives as accurate results as the MITC4 shell element in uniform meshes and even signiï¬cantly better results when distorted meshes are used.

reference solutions obtained using a 50 Ã 50 element mesh of the MITC4 shell element and veriï¬ed by Refs. [25,26]. Table 10 presents the frequencies calculated with N Ã N element meshes (N Â¼ 5, 10, 15 and 20) when a=L Â¼ 1=1; 000. The frequencies of the modes 7 to 9 are close to the reference solutions for all tested elements. The frequencies corresponding to modes 10 and 11 should be identical, but this can hardly be the case using triangular shell elements due to the non-symmetry in the mesh patterns used. While the MITC3 shell element produces considerably different frequencies for modes 10 and 11, the MITC3+ shell element shows very similar frequencies for the modes. Using the MITC4 and MITC3+ shell elements produces much more accurate frequencies than obtained with the MITC3 shell element. In Fig. 14, we see that the MITC3 shell element produces a wrong mode shape for the 11th frequency. The convergence curves of the 10th and 11th frequencies are plotted in Fig. 15. Three different thicknesses (a=L Â¼ 1=100; 1=1; 000 and 1=10; 000Ã are considered. The shell ï¬nite element solutions are calculated using four different N Ã N element meshes (N Â¼ 5, 10, 15 and 20). We observe that the performance of the MITC3 shell element deteriorates as the thickness decreases, that is, locking occurs. However, the MITC3+ and MITC4 shell elements show, similarly, excellent convergence. The distorted mesh shown in Fig. 16 is also considered. When an N Ã N element mesh is used, each edge is discretized by the following ratio: L1 : L2 : L3 : . . . LN = 1: 2: 3: . . . N. Table 11 presents the frequencies with distorted N Ã N element meshes (N Â¼ 5, 10, 15 and 20) when a=L Â¼ 1=1; 000. Fig. 17 shows the convergence curves of the 10th and 11th frequencies. In the both results, the MITC3+ and MITC4 shell elements still show good results even though the predicted modes 10 and 11 are slightly different. 5.2.

We use L Â¼ 1:0; E Â¼ 2:0 Ã 1011 , m Â¼ 1=3 and density q Â¼ 7:8 Ã 103 . No boundary condition is imposed. Table 12 presents the frequencies calculated with uniform 4N (circumferential direction) Ã 2N (longitudinal direction) element meshes (N Â¼ 5, 10, 15 and 20) when a=L Â¼ 1=1; 000. The reference solutions are obtained using a 200 Ã 100 uniform mesh of the MITC4 shell elements. For all the elements tested, the frequencies 7, 9 and 11 are identical to the frequencies 8, 10 and 12, respectively. Using the MITC4 and MITC3+ shell elements produces much more accurate frequencies than obtained with the MITC3 shell element. Fig. 19 displays the shapes of the modes 7â12 for uniform 20 Ã 10 element meshes, with the shapes of paired modes the same but for a rotation about the y-axis. The mode shapes of the MITC3+ shell element are similar to those of the MITC4 shell element. Fig. 20 displays the convergence curves of the 7th and 8th frequencies for three different thicknesses: a=L Â¼ 1=100; 1=1; 000, and 1=10; 000. The MITC3+ shell element displays good convergence behaviors similar to the MITC4 shell element. As the thickness decreases, the convergence of the MITC3 shell element becomes worse due to locking. We also consider the distorted mesh shown in Fig. 18(b). For the shaded region in Fig. 18(b), each edge is discretized as shown in
