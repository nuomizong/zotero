Shell Structures for Architecture
Bringing together experts from research and practice, Shell Structures for Architecture: Form Finding and Optimization presents contemporary design methods for shell and gridshell structures, covering form-finding and structural optimization techniques. It introduces architecture and engineering practitioners and students to structural shells and provides computational techniques to develop complex curved structural surfaces, in the form of mathematics, computer algorithms, and design case studies. Part I introduces the topic of shells, tracing the ancient relationship between structural form and forces, the basics of shell behaviour, and the evolution of form-finding and structural optimization techniques. Part II familiarizes the reader with form-finding techniques to explore expressive structural geometries, covering the force density method, thrust network analysis, dynamic relaxation and particle-spring systems. Part III focuses on shell shape and topology optimization, and provides a deeper understanding of gradientbased methods and meta-heuristic techniques. Part IV contains precedent studies of realised shells and gridshells describing their innovative design and construction methods. Sigrid Adriaenssens is a structural engineer and Assistant Professor at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Princeton University, USA, where she directs the Form Finding Lab. She holds a PhD in lightweight structures from the University of Bath, adapting the method of dynamic relaxation to strained gridshells. She worked as a project engineer for Jane Wernick Associates, London, and Ney + Partners, Brussels, on projects such as the Dutch National Maritime Museum in Amsterdam. At Princeton, she co-curated the exhibition ‘German Shells: Efficiency in Form’ which examined a number of landmark German shell projects. Philippe Block is a structural engineer and architect and Assistant Professor at the Institute of Technology in Architecture, ETH Zurich, Switzerland, where he directs the BLOCK Research Group, and is founding partner of structural engineering consultancy Ochsendorf, DeJong & Block LLC. He studied at the VUB, Belgium, and MIT, USA, where he obtained his PhD. He has received the Hangai Prize and Tsuboi Award from the International Association of Shells and Spatial Structures (IASS) as well as the Edoardo Benvenuto Prize. He developed thrust network analysis for the analysis of historic vaulted masonry and design of new funicular shells. Diederik Veenendaal is a civil engineer and a research assistant at the BLOCK Research Group, ETH Zurich, Switzerland. He received his Masters from TU Delft, Netherlands and started his career at Witteveen+Bos engineering consultants, working on groundfreezing analysis for the downtown stations of the Amsterdam North/South subway line and the structural design for the largest tensioned membrane roof in the Netherlands, the ice skating arena De Scheg. His current research involves the comparison of existing form-finding methods and development of new ones for flexibly formed shells and other structural systems. Chris Williams is a structural engineer and a Senior Lecturer at the University of Bath, UK. He specializes in computational geometry and structural mechanics, in particular for lightweight structures and tall buildings, and his work has been applied by architects and engineers, including Foster + Partners, Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners and Buro Happold. He worked at Ove Arup and Partners, where he was responsible for structural analysis of the Mannheim Multihalle. Since then, he has worked on such projects as the British Museum Great Court roof, Weald & Downland Museum gridshell, and the Savill Gardens gridshell.

FOREWORD

On architects and engineers
Jörg Schlaich

There is still a widespread misunderstanding concerning the role of architects and structural engineers: it is said that architects are the designers of a building from concept to detail, whereas the engineers (only) care for its stability. In fact, it is its function which clearly attributes a building to either an architect or an engineer only, or to both: to an architect only if it is multifunctional in a social context – typically a family house where no engineer is needed – and to an engineer only if it serves a singular structural purpose – typically built infrastructure such as a bridge where no architect is needed. A high-rise building typically needs both, an architect and an engineer. The more the form of a building or structure develops from its flow of forces, the more it is under the responsibility of the engineer. Especially due to the fact that most infrastructure, such as towers, power plants, long-span roofs and bridges, is large and long-lasting, a responsible engineer will seek the advice of an architect or a landscape designer when deciding on the material or the scale of their bridge or sports hall in an urban or natural environment. It is only culture that can convert our built environment into civilization. Shells play a special, singular role for engineers. Their shape directly derives from their flow of forces, and defines their load-bearing behaviour and lightness, saving material by creating local employment, their social aspect. This is especially true for thin concrete shells with their characteristic curvatures: single curvature (cylindrical and conical), synclastic (domelike), anticlastic (saddle-like) or free (experimental).

If well formed, there are no bending but membrane forces only (axial compression and tension) in a shell, permitting its thickness to be around 80mm for reinforced or prestressed concrete, even down to 12mm for fibre reinforced concrete (Fig. 0.1). Though these concrete shells initially do not leave much space for an architect (or even for the fantasy of an engineer), it is fortunately not unusual that the two collaborate fruitfully or that an engineer himself has the courage and imagination to go beyond strict logic. So Pier Luigi Nervi’s Palazzetto dello Sport in Rome would have fulfilled its purpose at considerably lower cost with a tensile ring on vertical supports instead of the inclined Y-shaped columns as built, but it would have looked like a boring and ugly tank (Fig. 0.2). Only a creative engineer could have made such a proposal as built! In case of the large hypar roof for the Hamburg Alster-Schwimmhalle, the architect insisted that the edge beams should be free cantilevering beyond the facade. This caused vivid discussions, because according to the classical shell literature a hypar shell cannot transfer shear forces from edge beams but needs direct support as evident from the wonderful Candela shells (Fig. 0.3). But the architect insisted and thus made us find a revolutionary though very simple solution by superimposing the classical saddle surface for the surface loads with the straight line generators’ surface for edge loads (Fig. 0.4). The result was a perfect structure thanks to the insisting architect. During the last decades concrete shells lost more ground to: 1) cable nets; 2) textile membranes; and 3) steel grids. In terms of their load bearing, these

can also be considered as shells. Let us discuss one example for each of them.

Cable nets
In 1967, the international competition for the sport fields of the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich was won by architects Behnisch+Partners from Stuttgart, even though they hardly fulfilled the requirements. In fact,

they instead brought in an idea which was absolutely convincing, to bring together under one continuous and floating roof all sports facilities: the stadium, the sport hall, the swimming hall, and all transitions connecting them (Fig. 0.5). This is exactly what we engineers expect from our architect if structure plays a significant role: an idea, a concept, a proposal, but leaving the structural solution to us. Together with Frei Otto and Fritz Auer from Behnisch+Partners, we developed a

prestressed cable-net structure with 75cm quadrangular mesh-width, adaptable to any shape, subdivided by edge cables, supported by masts, held down by anchors and, finally, covered with Plexiglas. This huge but nevertheless light and floating roof has been very well accepted and is still very popular, thanks to an ideal cooperation between architects and engineers, each of them playing their role in a useful manner.

The courtyard of the Museum of Hamburg History, L-shaped in plan, was to be covered with a glass roof, as light and transparent as possible. The architect Volkwin Marg expressed with his sketch his wishes, his ideas which stimulated our adequate structural solution: a quadrangular mesh or grid, 1.2/1.2m from 60mm × 40mm steel members, diagonally stiffened by thin, prestressed cables (Fig. 0.6). By change of angles, the grid can easily adapt to a smooth doubly curved transition between the two cylindrical shells, which themselves are stiffened by radial spokes (Fig. 0.6). Thus, the fear of the client that his historic building would suffer from the roof could be relieved.

Textile membranes
As we know from our clothes, we can produce doubly curved surfaces from plane textile with the help of a cutting pattern. If prestressed (by reducing the cutting patterns), they behave under loads as an ideal membrane shell and can even permit convertible roofs,

such as those for the Wolfgang Meyer Sports Centre Hamburg-Stellingen (Fig. 0.7). In a fruitful cooperation of architect and engineer neither of them will impose their opinion because it is only the result that counts! To build in untouched nature can only be justified by creating a responsible building culture.

Sharing the same spirit
Shigeru Ban

Shell structures are but one of many different, interesting structural systems. If a gridshell structure happens to be suitable for a project, I use it, but otherwise I design another appropriate system. An architect shouldn’t concentrate on one type of structure, and should take notice of all possible structural systems. Without an understanding of structures, we cannot design a building. If you would have some

materials, and so on; ideals I really share with him. Like me, Frei Otto is not a form-making architect, meaning that we always design according to a combination of structural logics, architectural constraints and the programmes contained within the structure. That’s why our collaboration went very well. We share the same spirit. If I design just a shell, I always try to look for the most appropriate, most structurally efficient shape to reduce bending moments and the size of the

preference, it would be very difficult to adjust to different programmes. Frei Otto is a notable exception. He has his own specialities: cable-net structures, membrane structures and lightweight structures. He does not design everything, yet he’s also an architect. When I got the commission for the Japan Pavilion at the 2000 Expo in Hannover (Fig. 0.8), I immediately contacted him, and he agreed to collaborate with me. This had been a dream ever since I was a student. He does not like to make complicated connections, he always strives for minimum effort, minimum labour, minimum

members. However, I might not always have total freedom to design the most minimal shape for the material, because the shape of the shell is also defined by other constraints. For the Centre Pompidou in Metz (Fig. 0.9), a museum, we needed to have large, column-free spans for the galleries underneath. As a result, it was designed as a large, suspended surface: part of it is in tension, some part in compression. At first sight, the Haesley Nine Bridges golf clubhouse has a similar system (Fig. 0.10). But, because we could have a repetition of the supports, it developed into a set of compressive arches, creating the characteristic quality of the internal space. So, the shapes came from the programme. The structural engineer Hermann Blumer worked on both of these projects, and was a key contributor to the design of the Centre Pompidou. After he joined our team, he went back to my original design and

solved all the technical problems. Nowadays, for any timber structure, in any country, I work with him. I just send him the design and he solves all the technical issues. He immediately understands what I want to do: the collaboration between us is really perfect. I choose particular engineers for particular projects. As an engineering student, you have to develop your own interests and understand your own abilities and limitations. Study under the guidance of a good professor, because an engineer always moves into a certain type of structure as a speciality. This is not a bad thing, but merely an observation. Some engineers are an exception and are capable of designing anything, like Jörg Schlaich, who is also good at shell structures. But, as I said, to me it is important that we can share the same spirit, the same priorities. Even if someone is a genius engineer, if we cannot share the same priorities, it doesn’t work out.

Introduction
In this book, leading experts from academia and practice describe design and optimization methods for the generation of efficient shell forms and topologies. Some of these techniques are part of the long history of the theory of shells, others have been developed or first used in practice by the authors themselves. Recent years have seen a renaissance of shells. Through advances in computational techniques and power, as well as novel fabrication and construction methods, engineers and architects have been imagining and creating elegant thin-shell structures. For shells to be efficient, their shape should depend on the flow of forces and vice versa and therefore their design requires a process of form finding. The ‘ideal’ form of a shell may need to fulfil additional architectural, mechanical or technical aspects necessitating some form of optimization. This makes the design and engineering of shell structures a highly involved process. Shell Structures for Architecture: Form Finding and Optimization offers a comprehensive overview and hands-on textbook for the form and topology generation of shells. Intended for students, researchers and professionals, both in architecture and in engineering, this book presents many new and established methods, and explains them through theory and through working design examples. This book is written so that each chapter exists as a complete entity in its own right, and can be read as such, but also so that the chapters fit together as a whole. Some of the chapters contain mathematics and for some people this aids their understanding and insight. However, it is equally true that some very gifted shell designers have used physical and computer models in their work and have not relied on advanced mathematical knowledge. Thus, it is not necessary to fully master the mathematics in one chapter before moving on to a following chapter. However, it is recommended to have some understanding of linear algebra and basic calculus, or have some references concerning these topics on hand. The mathematics applied to shell structures comes from diverse fields – geometry, structural mechanics, linear algebra, mathematical optimization, computer science and reliability theory – each with its own notation, and nobody is knowledgeable in all these fields. Engineers may know about structural mechanics, but not be well versed in geometry; mathematicians may know about geometry but not be particularly familiar with structural mechanics. Each person assembles their knowledge in a hotchpotch fashion since it is not possible to know all there is to know about shell structures. Nonetheless, this book is intended as a good starting point and provides advice on further reading throughout, explaining, for different topics, which references will best expand on particular topics.

Shells for architecture
The main application of the methods described in this book are shell structures in the context of the built environment. Shell structures are constructed systems described by three-dimensional curved surfaces, in which one dimension is significantly smaller compared to the other two. They are form-passive and resist external loads predominantly through membrane stresses. A ‘form-passive’ structural system does not significantly, actively change its shape under varying load conditions, unlike ‘form-active’ structural systems such as cable or membrane structures. A shell transfers external loads to its supports predominantly through forces acting in the plane of the shell surface, which are called membrane stresses and might be compression, or a combination of compression and tension. The word ‘membrane’ might suggest a film or fabric that can only carry tension, but the compressive stresses in a steel, concrete or masonry shell are still called membrane stresses. A ‘thin’ shell has to be sufficiently ‘thick’ to carry these compressive stresses

INTRODUCTION

without buckling. Shell structures can be constructed as a continuous surface or from discrete elements following that surface. In the latter case, we speak of lattice, reticulated or gridshells. These terms are synonymous; ‘gridshell’ will be used throughout this book. This book distinguishes between three types of geometries for shell structures: Freeform, free-curved or sculptural shells are generated without taking into consideration structural performance. If they are shaped digitally, then they are often described by higher degree polynomials (e.g. patches of Non-Uniform Rational Basis Splines (NURBS)). Mathematical, geometrical or analytical shells are directly described by analytical functions. These functions are often chosen for their convenience in performing further analytical calculations and their ability to describe a shell’s shape for fabrication purposes. These are often lower degree polynomials (hyperboloids, elipsoids and hyperbolic or elliptic paraboloids), or trigonometric or hyperbolic functions (the catenary). Form-found shells include natural, hanging shapes associated with the funicular structures of Antoni Gaudí, Frei Otto and Heinz Isler, but also ‘strained’ gridshells that feature bending stresses. If the shape is found digitally, it is initially parameterized by piecewise or higher degree polynomials. Their final shape is the result of attaining a state of static equilibrium. The general topic of shell structures is introduced in Part I of the book, ‘Shells for architecture’. Chapter 1 elaborates on the vast range of possible shapes for shells. Chapter 2 describes how we can conceive good structural forms. Chapter 3 asks what a shell is, and discusses the matter from a mathematical standpoint. A brief history of the use of physical models in the design of shells is provided in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 presents computational analogues for digital design and subsequent optimization, and focuses on different strategies for geometrical parameterization of curved surfaces. This chapter serves as an introduction to the numerical methods discussed in Part II and Part III of the book.

Form ﬁnding
The process of designing form-found shapes is called form finding or shape finding, where the former term is used in this book. Computational models for form finding may be a numerical simulation of the physical model involving hanging chains or cloth, or they might use imaginary properties that could not be simulated physically. In both physical and numerical hanging models, we note that form-active systems are exploited to find the shape of form-passive shell structures. We define the concept as: Form finding is a forward process in which parameters are explicitly/directly controlled to find an ‘optimal’ geometry of a structure which is in static equilibrium with a design loading. For shells, the design loading is typically the dead load, most often being its self-weight. For masonry or concrete shells, or glass-clad steel gridshells this load is dominant. Timber is relatively light, but creeps under load and therefore the permanent dead load assumes a greater importance. The parameters that can be imposed to control the form-finding process are: boundary conditions, supports, external loads; topology of the model and; internal forces, and their relationship to the geometry. The geometry is an unknown; form finding is the generation of geometry. However, the process may require some arbitrary starting geometry. Once the final shape is found, the numerical model is updated by assigning real physical material and member properties. This new updated model serves as a basis for structural analysis. Methods developed for the form finding of shell structures are discussed in Part II, ‘Form finding’. These methods solve the problem for static equilibrium, either without requiring material properties (force density method in Chapter 6 and thrust network analysis in Chapter 7), or by incorporating (fictitious) material or spring stiffness, and solving for dynamic equilibrium (dynamic relaxation in Chapter 8 and particle-spring simulation in Chapter 9).

optimal structures, one needs to formulate a general definition of the optimization problem: minimize f ( x )

Optimization
When additional objectives or constraints are introduced, methods of structural optimization are needed to solve for them. These methods can be applied to structural shapes resulting from form finding, but also to freeform or mathematical shapes. Different strategies for the solution of constrained optimization problems, in the context of the structural design of shells, are presented in Part III, ‘Structural optimization’. Structural optimization is an inverse process in which parameters are implicitly/indirectly optimized to find the geometry of a structure such that an objective function or fitness criterion is minimized. One can optimize for multiple objectives and does not have to be constrained to a single design loading. In this case, the objectives are evaluated based on their importance, either a priori using weightings or a posteriori by exploring the Pareto front. In multi-objective optimization, the objectives can include goals that are non-structural. Optimization often leads to a large set of feasible shapes, called the design space. In cases where such a design space is explored and we tend to more gradually develop a form, we may also encounter the term computational morphogenesis. The ‘optimal’ shape in the design space is subject to a set of given requirements (the constraints such as allowable deformations) and is defined with respect to one (or several) objectives, such as: the minimization of material and weight in a structure, aiming for material economy; the minimization of deflections or dynamic vibrations of a structure, ensuring serviceability of a structure; the maximization of stiffness (i.e. minimization of structural compliance), aiming for efficient loadbearing structures. When using mathematical optimization for finding

⎧ gi( x ) ≥ 0, i = 1,…,m subject to ⎨ hi( x ) = 0, i = 1,…,p ⎩ xi x, i = 1,…,n
Here, an objective function f ( x ) of the n design variables x subject to m + p constraints is minimized. These constraints are also expressed as functions of the design variables and they may be either equalities h( x ) – for example, that certain lengths are fixed – or inequalities g( x ) – for example, that the height should not exceed some value. Even though there is only one objective function, it can be a function of various quantities (e.g. cost, energy consumption), which are themselves functions of the design variables. Instead of just adding up these quantities, it is possible, for example, to minimize the sum of the squares of the cost and energy consumption, in which a weighting is assigned to give a monetary value to energy consumption. Alternatively, for multiple objective functions, a Pareto front is explored to assess the trade-offs between those, often competing, objectives. Optimization problems are encountered in a vast number of fields, and methods to solve them can be roughly divided in two groups: the local and the global methods. Local methods reach a local optimum, and therefore offer no guarantee in finding the global one, unless the problem is convex. The most common local methods are based on the computation (or approximation) of derivatives. Therefore, they require the functions to be differentiable, and the variables to be continuous (specific methods have also been proposed in the literature for discrete parameters). The most popular global methods to find a global optimum are often based on an imitation of phenomena observed in nature. They belong to metaheuristic methods, which can be defined as general trial-and-error strategies guiding the search for optimal solutions in hard problems. In these methods, there is no guarantee either that the

INTRODUCTION

optimal solution is systematically found, but they are designed for the purpose of finding a global optimum in complex problems and numerical experiments have demonstrated their efficiency in certain applications. These techniques include simulated annealing and evolutionary algorithms. The chapters in Part III use both local and global methods. Chapters 12, 13 and 17 use local, gradientbased methods. The remaining chapters of Part III describe metaheuristic techniques. Chapter 16 uses simulated annealing, whereas Chapters 14, 15 and 18 apply genetic algorithms, which are a subset of evolutionary algorithms. These are discussed in Appendix C. Structural optimization is traditionally classified in three categories depending on the nature of the variables involved: Shape optimization has variables acting on the geometry of the structure, without modifying the topology. Practically, in discrete structures, the node coordinates are often used directly as parameters to modify the geometry, but more advanced parameterizations are available (see Section 5.4 and Appendix D). Topology optimization deals with the situation in which the topology of the structure is not prescribed by the designer. The structure’s topology is defined by the connectivity of the nodes in the structure, and the existence or absence of elements. Sizing optimization has variables representing cross-sectional dimensions or transversal thicknesses (the geometry and the topology remaining fixed). For instance, in discrete structures (trusses,

rigid frames and gridshells), the areas of the cross sections usually are the design variables. Chapters 12, 13, 16 and 18 each deal with shape optimization, but towards different objectives and for different structural typologies. The approaches and parameterizations vary as well. Chapter 16 further discusses how to derive a discrete topology, or ‘structural pattern’, from the resulting shape. Chapter 21 from Part IV explains shape optimization as it has been applied by Mutsuro Sasaki in his practice. Chapters 14, 15 and 17 apply topology optimization. In Chapter 14, shape variables are also included, whereas Chapter 15 includes sizing optimization. Chapter 17 discusses continuum topology optimization, which aims to find the optimal layout of material in a given region, but applies this also to shape optimization.

Precedents
Throughout the book, examples are given of existing shell structures. Part IV, ‘Precedents’, provides more specific insights from built examples. Chapter 19 compares two seminal gridshell structures: the Mannheim Multihalle and the roof of the British Museum’s Great Court. In contrast, Chapter 20 compares two types of continuous concrete shells: the geometrical shapes by Félix Candela and the form-found shapes by Heinz Isler. The final chapter, Chapter 21, gives an overview of Mutsuro Sasaki’s concrete shell structures. The book concludes with ‘The congeniality of architecture and engineering’, a short note on the future and potential of shell structures.

PART I

Shells for architecture

CHAPTER ONE

Exploring shell forms
John Ochsendorf and Philippe Block
Shell structures will always have a role for architecture and engineering. More so than any other structural system, shells have the ability to create eye-catching forms, to provide freedom for design exploration and to resist loads efficiently. These attributes call for sustained interest in the mechanics and design of shell structures. For even the most highly constrained geometry, an infinite number of solutions are available to the shell designer. But each different shell geometry has advantages and disadvantages, and all shells are not equal. How then does the designer find shell forms that are inherently structural? Shell designers can invent forms by taking inspiration from nature, by innovating from precedent structures, or by exploring various formfinding possibilities. In all cases, designers must seek forms that offer multiple load paths for all expected applied loads, and whose formal possibilities are closely linked to the modes of construction. Master shell builders are deeply concerned with the final appearance of their shells as well as the construction processes to create them. Designers can always learn more from studying historical structures and this is especially true of shells. Traditional masonry shells have a long history in architecture and construction, and the inherent limitations of masonry material require that such structures work primarily in compression. Recent buildings such as the Mapungubwe Interpretive Centre, with structural shells made from unreinforced earthen bricks, demonstrate the potential for contemporary projects to take inspiration from historical construction systems (see page 6).

1.1

Hooke’s hanging chain

The shell designer seeks forms to carry the applied loads in axial compression with minimal bending forces. The earliest example of structural form finding for an arch was published by English engineer and scientist Robert Hooke (1635–1703). In 1676, Hooke published ten ‘Inventions’ in the form of anagrams of Latin phrases in order to protect his ideas. The third invention would later become known as Hooke’s law of elasticity, for which he is most known. The second (Fig. 1.1), describing ‘the true Mathematical and Mechanichal form of all manner of arches for building’ is given as:

Figure 1.1 Robert Hooke’s anagram on the means to ﬁnd the ideal compression-only geometry for a rigid arch (Hooke, 1676)

JOHN OCHSENDORF AND PHILIPPE BLOCK

The solution to this architectonic riddle was posthumously published by the secretary of the Royal Society, Richard Waller (1705), and read: Ut pendet continuum flexile, sic stabit contiguum rigidum inversum. (As hangs the flexible line, so but inverted will stand the rigid arch.) The idea is simple: invert the shape of the hanging chain, which by definition is in pure tension and free of bending, to obtain the equivalent arch that acts in pure compression. The form of the ideal arch will depend on the applied loading. For a chain of constant weight per unit length, the shape of a hanging chain acting under self-weight is a catenary (Fig. 1.2). But if the load is uniformly distributed horizontally, the ideal arch would take the form of a parabola, and the chain would take different geometries according to the loading. In addition, the span/rise ratio (L/d) can vary widely, though most shell structures occur in the range of 2 L/d 10. Thus, even a simple two-dimensional arch has infinite possible forms which would act in pure compression under self-weight, depending on the distribution of weight and the rise of the arch. This principle, which will be referred to in this

book as ‘Hooke’s law of inversion’, can be extended beyond the single arch and considered for shell structures of various geometries. In the context of shell structures, the term funicular means ‘tension-only’ or ‘compression-only’ for a given loading, typically considered as the shape taken by a hanging chain for a given set of loads. Three-dimensional funicular systems are considerably more complex because of the multiple load paths that are possible. Unlike the case of a hanging cable with a single funicular form between its two supports, hanging membranes have multiple possible forms. And unlike the two-dimensional arch, the three-dimensional shell can carry a wide range of different loadings through membrane behaviour without introducing bending. To continue the analogy with Hooke’s hanging chain, a three-dimensional model of intersecting chains could be created. This hanging model could be used to design a discrete shell, in which elements are connected at nodes, or the model could be used to help define a continuous surface. If hanging from a continuous circular support, the model-builder could create a network of meridional chains and hoop chains. By adjusting the length of each chain, various tension-only solutions can be found when hanging under self-weight only. Once inverted, this geometry would represent a compression-only form. Such a model would quickly illustrate that many different shell geometries can function in compression due to self-weight. As an example, Figure 1.3 illustrates three shell structures supported on a circular base: a cone, a shallow spherical dome and a dome with an upturned oculus in the centre. All three forms can contain compression-only solutions due to self-weight according to classical membrane theory (see Chapter 3). Of course some solutions perform better under varying load conditions and the double

curvature of the dome is structurally superior to the single curvature of the cone in the event of asymmetrical live loading. The conclusion is clear: for networks of intersecting elements, there is no unique funicular solution.

1.2

Masonry shells in compression

Masonry shells have been built for centuries around the world in the form of arches, domes and vaults. Such shells exist primarily in compression, because masonry materials such as brick and stone are strong in compression and weak in tension. The challenge is to find geometries that can work entirely in compression under gravity loading. These geometries are not limited only to masonry, and will often provide efficient geometries for structures built of any material. However, for traditional masonry structures, the dominant loading is often due to the self-weight of the structure, and the applied live loadings due to wind or snow have a smaller effect. As a practical demonstration of the multiple compressive solutions in three dimensions, consider the wide variety of shell geometries constructed in masonry tile commonly known as the Catalan vault or Guastavino method of construction. Compression-only tile vaults supported on a circular plan can take many possible geometries, ranging from conical to spherical as demonstrated by the structures in Figure 1.4. Even in brittle masonry structures, numerous openings can be made in shells and the resulting compressive solutions must therefore flow around the openings, as in the Bronx Zoo dome of 1909 (Fig. 1.4, middle). The supports must be capable of resisting the large reaction forces at the base of these structures, and in particular, shallow domes will create a large outward thrust at the base, which is commonly contained with a tension ring at the base of the dome to maintain equilibrium. Though traditional masonry shells were often constructed without structural calculations, historical vault builders developed a keen awareness of the multiple equilibrium states possible in doubly curved masonry shells. These surfaces could be built in masonry because they can contain thrust surfaces in compression, similar to a grid of interconnected hanging chains. Thus, Robert Hooke’s guiding principle for the

Figure 1.4 (top) Conical shell by Rafael Guastavino, Sr., Bristol County Courthouse, Taunton, MA, 1891, (middle) shallow spherical dome, Bronx Zoo Elephant House by Rafael Guastavino, Jr., New York City, NY, 1909, and (bottom) shallow spherical shell with upturned oculus, Pines Calyx by Helionix Designs, Dover, 2007.

ideal form of arches can also offer guidance on the form of shells. For the primary masonry dome of St Paul’s Cathedral in London, Hooke suggested a cubico-parabolical conoid form to Christopher Wren (1632–1723), which is the ideal form of a compressive dome with zero hoop forces (Heyman, 1998) (see also

Section 4.2). However, many more forms are possible for shells in masonry.

1.3

An inﬁnite number of structural forms

The challenge of shell design is to find the appropriate form for the given problem. And the joy of shell design is that an infinite number of structural forms are waiting to be discovered. Even highly constrained boundary conditions can still lead to a vastly rich landscape of forms to explore. For example, by continuing the challenge of finding compressiononly solutions on a continuously supported circular base, one can discover an infinite array of options. Figure 1.5 demonstrates additional options found through thrust network analysis, which allows the shell designer to redistribute compressive forces within statically indeterminate networks (Chapter 7). By exploring numerous boundary conditions, additional forms are possible. Historical spiral

staircases in masonry are constrained within a cylinder, allowing the compression-only geometries to move beyond the planar support (Fig. 1.6). As with a dome or a cone in masonry, such spiral shells can stand in pure compression through a combination of meridional and hoop forces in equilibrium around a central oculus. It is important to note that the classical analysis methods applied to shells rely only on equations of equilibrium, and do not depend on invoking elasticity or other material properties in order to estimate the membrane forces in shells. The goal of the shell designer is to discover an array of forces in equilibrium with the applied loads. While leading shell designers of the twentieth century demonstrated that numerous structural forms are waiting to be discovered, other projects demonstrated the pitfalls of shell design. The shell-like forms of the Sydney Opera House were created from sections of a sphere, which simplified the geometry (see also Section 4.3). But the chosen geometry did not have any particular structural advantages, and

could not function effectively as a structural shell. The resulting ribcage of beam elements must resist significant bending stresses and was very costly to build. In fact, the project took three times longer to build than originally expected and the final cost was more than fourteen times the original estimate. Though the Sydney Opera House is a successful work of architecture, it is a poor structure and it serves as a cautionary tale to designers seeking to build shells without careful attention to the flow of forces in the conceptual design stage.

Conclusion

Shell designers can take inspiration from any number of sources. But Robert Hooke’s powerful axiom provides a clear path forward: like the inverted chain, forces should flow in axial compression toward the supports with minimal bending. If Hooke’s chain is extended into a three-dimensional network of elements and if multiple support conditions are considered, then an infinite number of forms exist for compression-only shells. By minimizing bending forces, designers can build more efficiently and can make better use of limited resources. And by understanding and exploring the infinite possibilities for even a highly constrained design problem, shell designers can continue to discover new forms for centuries to come. The builders of masonry vaults have discovered a remarkable variety of shell forms acting

CHAPTER TWO

Shaping forces
Laurent Ney and Sigrid Adriaenssens
If you are reading this text, then you are a student, an engineer, an architect, or a person who is interested in the design of structures, specifically shells. You would like to learn how to design innovative structural forms by using context-sensitive parameters, exploring a variety of materials, creating aesthetical shapes and making your brainchild a reality. This is the creative mission, getting from the dream to the practical truth. But reality has its own constraints. In the world of structures, the dictates of science, statics and gravity, or in other words, the rules of nature itself, play the defining role. How does gravity influence a structure? Without gravity a dome would be flat. Gravity lies at the heart of our initial problem, but can also provide the beginning of the enjoyment in a creative design process. Where would be the excitement in designing a flat structure? The context of gravity is our playground. This design driver is a hard constraint but gives birth to a realm of intriguing complex spatial structural shapes. No gravity, no fun. Purely statically speaking, a structure is a device that channels loads to the ground. The funicular cable, for example, is a commonly misunderstood structural system (the word funicular comes from the Latin word funiculus, a diminutive form of funis, meaning a ‘slender rope’, or ‘string’). The shape a cable takes under applied loads is the result of force equilibrium. The cable is a form-active system. With no flexural stiffness, the shape a cable assumes under applied loads mirrors the axial tensile forces acting in it, that is, the cable shape and the action line of forces coincide. Well-designed shells, however, will mostly be loaded in compression. Their structural behaviour is different from form-active tensile systems in three ways: the shell cannot self-adjust its shape to varying loading conditions (it is form-passive); the deformations due to the elasticity of the material generate undesirable additional bending moments; the shell can be in unstable equilibrium – just like a ball on top of a hill (Fig. 2.1). A small disturbance – for example, a small horizontal external force – will irreversibly disturb the equilibrium of the ball or shell system. In summary, variations in applied loading on a tensile system (such as cables, cable nets, technical textiles) induce variations in shape. The new, resulting shape remains stable, the resulting stresses stay in the allowable range and the structure is safe. In other words, the sensitivity of a tensile system to load or shape variations is low, and the robustness of the structure is high. Our aim is to design a robust structure that remains safe under expected (or unexpected) load variations. The balloon, a tensile internally pressurized structure (Fig. 2.2), is, in this context, a good example when subjected to unforeseen wind gusts; it remains safe.

Physical, graphical or numerical techniques can exploit the form-active behaviour of tensile systems to generate forms. Interestingly enough, Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926), Heinz Isler (1926–2009) and Frei Otto (b. 1925) first exploited physical, gravity-loaded, inverted hanging models as form-finding tools for designing shell structures, based on ideas first introduced in Hooke’s law of inversion (see Section 1.1): ‘As hangs the flexible line, so but inverted will stand the rigid arch.’ Tensile shape inversion gives us forms for shells but no information about their stability or robustness. How safe and stable is our form-found shell? What is the influence of the material’s elasticity, shrinkage and creep? How does load variation affect the shell’s structural behaviour? These issues, negligible in a tensile structure, are crucial to the successful design of a shell. How to deal with these challenges in a form-finding process remains unclear to this day. Finite element methods can be a help but come with the caveat that they might lead to incorrect conclusions. Some general shell design guiding principles are known, such as a singly curved shell will be less robust than a

doubly curved one, but these rules are not sufficient to design structurally efficient, safe shells. Form-finding methods generate ideal shapes that are the result of stable force equilibrium. In the real world, the shell is the origin of force equilibrium and is itself not perfect! In the real world, we cannot construct exactly the desired ideal equilibrium shape. Due to the elasticity of the material, material imperfections, on-site construction tolerances and so forth, the built form will always slightly deviate from the perfect one. The shell should be able to manage this inherent difference as well as unpredicted load variations. In fact, we want to construct a structure that keeps the equilibrium of forces while being as close as possible to the form-found surface. If we achieve this objective, structural material is minimized and the resulting design is efficient, light and economic. Like in the chicken and the egg quandary, we are trying to find a suitable, real structural design with an ideal force equilibrium situation. Caveat lector – the final form governs the channelling of forces rather than the forces determining the shape. We have seen that gravity is a tough constraint in the design process. Do we conclude that gravity is a limitation of creativity? No, we believe that the possibilities of structures are infinite. We can call them optimal structures, whatever optimal means. The world of optimal forms is immense. We can compare it to a Pareto front, in that the optimal solution is never unique but rather an accumulation of ideal solutions. This being said, the world of bad solutions is also infinite. Chances of designing a terrible structure are of course higher. Compared to the universe, the optimal systems are the stars and the bad solutions are the rest of the universe. Pursuing this train of thought, galaxies are the different possible typologies of structures. Looking at the widespread construction of arbitrarily bulging, organic forms, or ‘blobitecture’, we see that it belongs to the emptiness of the universe and not to the stars. Strangely enough, starchitects are responsible for most of this contemporary design trend. We see three reasons for this phenomenon: architectural dematerialization or virtualization; limitless finite element power; engineering design education and practice.

CHAPTER T WO: SHAPING FORCES

17

First, current architecture is shifting from the real to the virtual world. In the design process, a lot of thought and perspiration goes into the creation and rendering of a digital three-dimensional model. The virtual images show no difference when compared with pictures of a realized design. The crucial architectural marketing cycle can be reduced from sketch–plan–build–reality–picture–publish to sketch– render–publish. To be a celebrated architect, there is no longer a need to construct. A new generation of architects has built their fame in a virtual world. It is faster and easier. But this virtual world does not have the same rules and constraints as the real one: no gravity, no budget, no rain, no snow and no sun, nothing besides geometry. It stimulates image architecture. The actual realization of the image comes as an afterthought. Unfortunately, the structural solutions necessary to make these new shapes possible typically use an awkward and significant amount of material. Second, the increasing power of structural design tools through Finite Element (FE) analysis gives us the feeling that everything is possible. Like Zarathustra, we master nature by building against it and not with it. This display of trendy demiurgic control leads to clumsy, silly, expensive and complex structures and occurs because of a lack of structural thinking in the preliminary design process. As engineers, we can always find solutions to difficulties in the post-design phase instead of trying to avoid these problems in the first place. Third and last, any structural engineering ‘design’ course mostly focuses on FE modelling and code verification. Too few courses teach how to design an efficient structure, how to develop the right form. For most engineers this domain appears mysterious, complex and to be avoided. Due to the specificity of each project and time and cost restraints, form modification or optimization is difficult to integrate in a normal structural engineering workflow. In other related engineering disciplines (such as aerospace and automobile) or much older trades (such as ship building and armoury), optimization and modification are commonplace. As a consequence, structural engineers will say how much but not how. Form only seems to belong to the architectural and not the structural world. Geometry rests on an untouchable pedestal. But, we have seen that shape is the fundamental

parameter to obtaining structural efficiency in a shell. We can thus state that the first thing to generate is the form. Form belongs to the structural playground too! The question remains: ‘How can we know if a shell is well conceived?’ A more difficult question still is: ‘How can we design a good structure “ex nihilo”?’ This complex question cannot be answered in a few words; the aim of this book is to help us in this search. We can also learn from the past how to design for the future. We might ask ourselves why some historic structures remain interesting, appealing and intriguing. The scalloped dome of the Hagia Sophia (537– present) – one of the most ambitious, advanced and largest monuments of late Antiquity – seems to float above its nave and, in doing so, has a mystical quality of light. Pendentives transition the dome elegantly into the square shape of its support piers. Although this masterpiece looks simple, its design has a complex and subtle quality to it. The central dome we see today, built in 558, has withstood nearly 1,500 years in a seismic region. Today, most engineers fear shells and domes: they are mysterious and difficult to assess and master. Today, we are not able – or should we say, willing – to design these curved systems. Historic arches, shells and vaults are too easily seen as risks instead of opportunities. Under the motto of ‘safety’, these structures are destroyed and replaced by common beam-column systems. This is regrettable: their great historic and aesthetical value is lost forever. A better understanding and assessment of their structural behaviour holds the key to their conservation. It is not a sort of romanticism about historical structures that leads to these thoughts. Rather that shells and arches are highly efficient structures. Vernacular vaulted structures can give us further clues to finding appropriate curved forms that evolve out of structural logic. The basis for their designs is informed by local reflections about urban and social planning, history, structure, stability, site, materials and local skills. In the highly dense urban fabric of the Cycladic islands, vaulted living units express the individual, yet emphasize the island’s unity, community and permanence (Fig. 2.3). The island’s hilly sites challenge the builder to explore views, natural lighting and ventilation in their vaults. The lack of forests and abundance of rock, stone and clay drive construction techniques towards

18

the use of masonry, a composite material excellent in compression. These are some of the constraints that form the base for the design process. The anonymous local master builder manipulates the curved vaults to optimize height, light or views. Although the form emerges out of a structural rationale, all the contextual constraints and considerations contribute to the final form, adding an extra richness to it. These hybrid designs might not offer the best solution but produce a form that offers a solution to all constraints. In our projects we aim to design force-modelled forms, rooted in a structural, economic, cultural and technological logic. The two-dimensional geometry of the 2011 courtyard roof of the Scheepvaartmuseum, or Dutch National Maritime Museum, in Amsterdam reflects the symbolism and the building’s history as a seventeenth-century gunpowder warehouse of the Dutch fleet (Figs. 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6, and page 14). Its grid is based on rosettes with loxodromes, figures on historical sea charts to mark out the courses of a ship. The dome’s three-dimensional form is based on the numerical shape inversion of a hanging chain net using the dynamic relaxation technique presented in Chapter 8. The concentration of constraints in one definite structural context leads to a design with a poetic overtone. Its shape is unattainable to

CHAPTER THREE

What is a shell?
Chris Williams
Structures can be classified in many ways according to their shape, their function and the materials from which they are made. The most obvious definition of a shell might be through its geometry. A structure or structural element may be a fully three-dimensional solid object, or it might have some dimensions notably smaller than others. A beam is straight and it is relatively long in comparison to its cross section. Thus it is defined by a straight line. An arch is defined by a curved line and a plate by a plane. A shell is a structure defined by a curved surface. It is thin in the direction perpendicular to the surface, but there is no absolute rule as to how thin it has to be. It might be curved in two directions, like a dome or a cooling tower, or it may be cylindrical and curve only in one direction. This definition would clearly include birds’ eggs and concrete shells, and nobody would argue with that. It would also include ships, monocoque car bodies (coque is one of the French words for shell) and aircraft fuselages, drinks cans, glasses cases (Fig. 3.1), all sorts of objects. But this definition would also include tension structures such as sails, balloons and car tyres. If one wanted to exclude tension structures, one might stipulate that shells have to work in both tension and compression, but how about masonry vaults that can only work in compression? Most people would describe masonry vaults as a type of shell structure.

Figure 3.1

A glasses case is a shell

However, the word ‘shell’ has the implication of something relatively rigid, and this book is about such structures. We therefore need to have a separate category of tension structures to include sails and balloons as well as piano strings and fishing nets. Then we have six possible types of structure: straight-line elements (beams, columns); curved-line elements (arches, curved cables); plates (flat surface structures such as slabs, walls); tension structures (curved surface structures such as nets and fabric structures); shell structures (curved surface structures typically of timber, concrete, metal or masonry); fully three-dimensional lumps of material.

A colander (Fig. 3.2a) is a curved surface structure. It contains holes for draining food, but these holes do not stop it being a shell. It is a continuous surface with a relatively small area removed. A sieve (Fig. 3.2b) is very similar, except that the surface is made from a large number of initially straight wires which are woven into a flat sheet and then bent into a hemisphere. It is also a shell, a gridshell. Clearly there is some similarity between a sieve and a spider web – they are both lattice-like and are intended to catch things. The spider web is essentially flat and made up of straight elements and when the wind blows, it bows outwards like a sail and becomes curved. It therefore adjusts its shape to the loading (Fig. 3.3). We call this a ‘form-active’ structure. This feature is characteristic of tension structures. The sieve may be in tension, compression or a mixture of the two, but appears rigid. It does not significantly adjust its shape to the applied loading and, therefore, we call this a ‘form-passive’ structure. Where it is in compression, deflections lead to the structure

becoming less able to carry the load, possibly leading to buckling. Columns carry loads via axial forces, but bending stiffness is required to stop buckling, and so it is with shells, although with shells buckling is resisted by a combination of bending and in-plane action.

construction of the Pantheon in Rome, is an archetypal shell, is hemispherical, featuring an oculus at the top, and is included in our definition of the term ‘shell’.

3.1

How do shells work?

Shells use all the modes of structural action available to beams, struts, arches, cables and plates, plus another mode that we might call ‘shell action’, which we will now try to pin down. Structural elements that approximate to linear elements (i.e. with one dimension greater than the other two such as beams, arches and cables) or to surfaces (i.e. with one dimension smaller than the other two such as plates and shells) all share the same property: they are much easier to bend than to stretch. We use the word ‘stretch’ to mean change in length, possibly getting shorter, a ‘negative stretch’. Clearly a cable will stretch when we apply a tension to it. A column will undergo a negative stretch when we apply a compression to it. But if we apply more load, it will buckle and get shorter through bending, rather than axial strain. A parabolic arch or cable can carry a uniform vertical load per unit horizontal length using only axial compression or tension. The component of load perpendicular to the cable is balanced by the axial force multiplied by the curvature. Thus load in kNm-1 is balanced by a force in kN multiplied by the curvature in m-1. Note that curvature is defined as 1/radius of curvature. Other loads will cause bending moments in the arch or deflection of the cable. The arch-bending moment is the product of the thrust and its eccentricity from the axis.
3.1.1 Flat plates and plane stress

stress’ is used for in-plane loading and it appears in all sorts of situations; for example, the bending of an I-beam. Clearly the beam is loaded perpendicular to its axis, but most of the stress in the web and flanges are in the plane of the steel plates. Out of plane loading of a plate or slab produces plate bending and, as we have already noted, it is much easier to bend a plate than to stretch it. In Figure 3.4 we have introduced the components of membrane stress: normal stress in the x-direction , normal stress in the y-direction y, shear stress x perpendicular to the x-direction in the y-direction and shear stress perpendicular to the y-direction xy in the x-direction yx. In-plane membrane stress is a central concept in shell theory and corresponds to the axial stress in an arch – as opposed to the bending stress. Membrane stress is usually quoted as a force per unit length crossing an imaginary cut, rather than force per unit area. Equilibrium of moments about the normal tells us that xy = yx.

In order to understand curved arches, we first learn about straight beams. Similarly, to understand shells, we first need to think about something simpler. We could start with arches and go from curved lines to curved surfaces. Or we could start with plates and go from flat surfaces to curved surfaces. Both approaches can be helpful, but let us start with plates. A flat plate can be loaded by forces in its own plane (Fig. 3.4) or out of plane (Fig. 3.5). The term ‘plane

The shear stresses xy and yx are in the plane of the plate. We also get shear stress perpendicular to the plate due to plate bending. These are not labelled in Figure 3.5 because the notation for plate bending is rather confusing. Thus for plane stress we have three unknown stresses, x, y and xy = yx.

Thus we have three unknown stresses and only two equations of equilibrium so that plane stress is statically indeterminate.

In the membrane theory of shells, we still have three components of membrane stress, exactly as in plane stress. But, we now have three equations of equilibrium. Two of them are in the directions tangent to the shell, exactly as in the case of plane stress. The third equation is perpendicular to the tangent to the shell surface. The load is balanced by the membrane stresses multiplied by the curvature. Here the load would be in kNm-2, the membrane stress in kNm-1 and the curvature in m-1. Thus we have three unknown stresses and three equations of equilibrium so that shells should be statically determinate. Unfortunately, we have three partial differential equations of equilibrium in three unknown membrane stresses, and whether or not these equations have a solution depends upon the shape of the shell and the boundary conditions. This is a very difficult area of mathematics and it is often impossible to say whether a solution exists or not, let alone find one. The simplest way to express this mathematically is using plane coordinates. The horizontal equilibrium equations (3.1) still apply if the stress components are redefined as the horizontal component of membrane stress per unit horizontal length. In particular, if a shell is only loaded in the vertical direction, the horizontal equilibrium equations are still satisfied by use of the Airy stress function. Then equilibrium in the vertical direction is simply ∂2 ∂2z ∂2 ∂2z ∂2 ∂2z w = ___ ___ − 2____ ____ + ___ ___ , 2 2 ∂x∂y ∂x∂y ∂y 2 ∂x 2 ∂x ∂y (3.6)

functions of x and y. This equation may not look any more complicated than the biharmonic equation (3.5), but depending upon the shape of the shell and the boundary conditions, it may be impossible to solve for . Equation 3.6 is ‘exact’ in that it does not assume that the slope of the shell is small.

Figure 3.6 A dome, (a) without and (b) with an oculus, and (c) a cooling tower

If the shell is the wrong shape or it does not have enough boundary support, it may be a mechanism as far as the membrane theory is concerned and be able to undergo inextensional deformation, that is, deformation in which the shell is bent without stretching. The dome and cooling tower in Figures 3.6a and 3.6c are statically determinate and cannot undergo inextensional deformation. The cooling tower has a big hole at the top, but putting a big hole in a dome produces a structure which is a mechanism, Figure 3.6b. Figure 3.7 shows a detail of inextensional deformation in the region of a hole in a sphere. The deformation increases rapidly as the hole is approached, and the smaller the hole, the greater the deformation. However, for very small holes, the bending stiffness takes over and controls the deformation and this is what happens with the colander. The appendix to the paper On bells by Lord Rayleigh (1842–1919) contains the mathematics necessary to find the modes of

inextensional deformation of any surface of revolution, with particular reference to the hyperboloid of one sheet – the cooling tower (Rayleigh, 1890). However, attaching the cooling tower to the ground prevents these modes. The difference between the dome and the cooling tower is that the dome is synclastic and has positive Gaussian curvature whereas the cooling tower is anticlastic and has negative Gaussian curvature. Kelvin (1824–1907) wrote: ‘We may divide curved surfaces into Anticlastic and Synclastic. A saddle gives a good example of the former class; a ball of the latter. The outer portion of an anchor-ring is synclastic, the inner anticlastic’ (Kelvin & Tait, 1867). Here saddle refers to that on a horse and an anchor-ring is a torus. The Gaussian curvature is the product of the two principal curvatures on a surface and they are of opposite sign on a cooling tower. Gauss’s theorem (Theorema Egregium) tells us that the Gaussian curvature of a surface can be calculated by only measuring lengths on a surface, and therefore inextensional deformation does not change the Gaussian curvature. A developable surface is a surface with zero Gaussian curvature which can be laid out flat. Examples include cylinders and cones. Gauss’s Theorem is derived in Appendix B. The Cohen-Vossen theorem from differential geometry tells us that it is not possible to deform a closed convex surface such as an egg without changing lengths on the surface; in other words, inextensional deformation is impossible. However, part of an egg can be deformed inextensionally, explaining why it is so much more flexible. The stiffness of the part can be regained by glueing it to a support to form a dome on a foundation. This is a difficult concept because engineers are more used to thinking about forces rather than length changes. But a two-dimensional statically determinate pin-jointed truss can resist loads because it is not possible to deform it without changing the lengths of its members. The tension in a member is just the member trying to stop its length increasing.
3.1.3 Bending theory of shells and buckling

If a shell can undergo inextensional deformation, then it will have to rely on bending stiffness as well as membrane action in order to carry any load case,

including wind and snow. However, even if a shell has the correct shape and is properly supported, it must have bending stiffness to prevent buckling if there are any compressive membrane stresses. Thus, for efficiency, we want our shell to work primarily by membrane action, which is what shell action means, but we know that we must also have bending stiffness to resist buckling and inextensional deformation. Shell buckling is particularly nasty because shell structures are so efficient. Almost no deflection occurs and then suddenly there is total collapse. Paradoxically, the less efficient the shell, in terms of shape, triangulation of the surface and boundary support, the better it behaves in buckling. This is because bending action of shells requires much more deflection than membrane action and therefore small irregularities in shell geometry and other initial imperfections have less effect. Experiments show that a properly supported shell working primarily by membrane action can never support anything like the theoretical ‘eigenvalue’ buckling load or ‘linear’ buckling load even when the utmost care is taken to eliminate initial imperfections. The analysis of shell buckling by hand calculations is effectively impossible, even eigenvalue analysis of a spherical shell is very difficult and, as we have said, gives wildly optimistic answers. This means that there is no option but to use computer analysis, but this is quite an esoteric area, and even though many programs offer analysis for shell buckling, the results should be treated with a great deal of circumspection.

theory of shells, leaving a detailed reading to those with a strong constitution. Thus in practice one has three possible approaches: simple hand calculations ‘informed’ by the classical theory of shells; numerical analysis using a computer; physical testing. Numerical analysis almost invariably uses the finite element method (see also Appendix A) in the form of shell elements for continuous shells or beam elements for gridshells. The derivation of the finite element equations does not really depend very much on the theory of shells, except for being able to work in curvilinear coordinates. The shape functions of the finite element method produce algebraic equations. These equations may be linear or nonlinear according to the material behaviour and whether one is concerned with buckling. The equations might be solved using an ‘implicit’ method involving inversion of a stiffness matrix or an ‘explicit’ method such as dynamic relaxation or Verlet integration. However, the structural behaviour of shells can be so complicated that numerical predictions may be inaccurate and so there is still a place for physical testing. Physical testing of ‘sketch models’ can also give a qualitative insight that cannot be obtained from a numerical analysis.

How much do we need to know to design a shell?

In the previous section, we tried to describe how shells work in a relatively qualitative manner. It should by now be clear that it is difficult to derive the equations (particularly for the bending theory) and usually impossible to solve them, except for the membrane theory for very simple shapes. The theory of shell structures, as described in such classic works as Novozhilov (1959), Flügge (1960), Green & Zerna (1968), Billington (1982), Calladine (1983) is very mathematical. In Appendix B, there is an introduction to the differential geometry and the

Figure 3.8 shows funicular polygons. The rope automatically adjusts its shape to carry the loads without any bending moment. The rope is a mechanism, which moves to carry one particular load case. We have seen that, if we are lucky, a shell can carry any load by membrane action only. However, if our shell has the wrong shape or is not properly supported, it will only be able to carry certain loads for which it is funicular. We might also have a shell which does not have sufficient bending stiffness to work in compression, like a fabric. Or we might have a masonry structure which only works in compression. Thus, in masonry, a funicular load is one that can be carried without any bending moment or tensile membrane stress.

Reversing the loads on a pure tension structure produces a pure compression structure, a fact used by Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926) for the Colònia Güell and Frei Otto (b. 1925) for the Multihalle.
3.3.1 Funicular arches and cables

It can be seen that the two curves are identical when their slope is low and they only peel apart when the load per unit horizontal length on the catenary increases with slope. The catenary is one of the few curves for which there is a simple relationship between x and y and the arc length along the curve, s, starting from the bottom, s= dy ∫ √1 + ( ___ ) dx

A rope or chain hanging under its self-weight forms a catenary (from ‘catena’, the Latin word for chain). Thus, the catenary is a particular case of a funicular curve. The catenary is of some relevance to the design of shells, so it is worth deriving the mathematical form here. If a cable is only carrying vertical loads, then the horizontal component H of tension in the cable, H = T cos = constant, (3.7)

It is relatively easy to find the funicular load for a given shape of cable or funicular shape for a given load, either by doing a simple physical experiment, mathematically, or graphically using graphic statics. Having found the shape, it can be inverted, or turned upside down, to find the best shape for the equivalent compression structure or arch.

If a non-funicular load is added, it will produce bending moments and cause a deviation of the line of thrust. The concept of funicular load applies particularly to structures that have to carry one dominant load case, perhaps their self-weight or some permanent load due to water or soil. Arch bridges such as the Gaoliang Bridge (Fig. 3.10) have to carry the extra weight of the masonry and fill over the support, together with the horizontal thrust from the fill. This means that more curvature is required towards the supports than would be the case for a catenary.

where t0 is the thickness at the top of the arch. Figure 3.11 shows a constant stress arch. Let us now think about scale. If the arch is made from a weak masonry we might have g = 25×103Nm-3 and = 0.5MPa = 0.5×106Nm-2. Therefore /( g) = 20m which means that if we decided to use the part of the arch in Figure 3.11 between -1.25 and +1.25 on the horizontal axis, the span would be 50m. If we used concrete at a stress of 25MPa, the corresponding span will be 1.25km for an arch under self-weight only. Figure 3.12 shows a comparison of the catenary, circular and constant stress arches. They all have the same thickness and curvature (and therefore stress) at the top. However, the catenary will have stress increased by a factor of 2.5 at the supports. So the catenary is not a particularly good shape for an arch or a barrel, unless practical considerations mean that it has to have a constant thickness.

This is exactly the same result that we obtained for the uniformly stressed arch, which is a special case of the uniformly stressed shell.

The equivalent of the uniformly stressed arch is the uniformly stressed shell of revolution.

3.4

Conclusion

The uniform stress shell illustrated in the previous section describes some sort of ‘optimum’, at least for the case when the self-weight of the structure dominates. However, in practice, there will be all sorts of functional and aesthetic constraints which will mean that the shell will not be structurally optimum. The Aichtal Outdoor Theatre, or Naturtheater Grötzingen (Fig. 3.14), by Michael Balz and Heinz Isler, is clearly not ‘properly’ supported all around its boundary. If it were, it would not fulfil the architectural and aesthetic constraints. However, the negative Gaussian curvature ‘lip’ at the free edges reduces the possibility of inextensional modes of deformation and therefore is an optimal design. At the beginning we asked two questions: What is a shell? And how do they work? We can summarize our discussion as follows: Shell structures can be geometrically represented by surfaces. Shells are relatively rigid and this distinguishes them from tension structures such as balloons and sails. Shells work through a combination of membrane and bending action. Membrane action is more efficient

Figure 3.14 Aichtal Outdoor Theatre with a ‘lip’ at the free edges, Germany, 1977

but bending action is required to stop buckling and possible inextensible modes of deformation. The more efficient the shell, the more sudden the buckling collapse. Hand calculations for shells are very difficult or impossible. However, some understanding of shell theory will help with the choice of shell shape and interpreting computer and model test results.

CHAPTER FOUR

Physical modelling and form ﬁnding
Bill Addis
The fundamental tasks of the structural engineer are: to provide sufficient information about the form of a structure, the dimensions and relative disposition of its components, as well as material specifications, to enable a contractor to begin construction and; to raise to a sufficient level the confidence of the engineer and builder that a proposed structure can be constructed and, once constructed, will work as intended. In the context of designing a shell structure, this definition can be reduced to two questions: How can a three-dimensional geometric shape be defined, described or communicated from one person to another? Or, put another way, how can a three-dimensional form be generated in the mind of its creator? Which three-dimensional forms are most suitable for a shell structure in order that the designer gains sufficient confidence that the structure will work as intended? Since ancient times, building designers have used both mathematical and physical models to answer both these questions. The concrete vaults and domes built by the Romans, which are the earliest ancestors of modern thin-shell structures, were cylindrical or hemispherical. In late medieval cathedrals, pointed arches and vaults, formed with two circular arcs, were widely used because they allowed the height and span of a vault to be varied independently. A large number of design procedures were developed using geometrical shapes (circles, squares and triangles) to help determine the shapes and dimensions of masonry arches and vaults as well as their abutments. In fact, it was widely believed that the resulting designs were suitable and efficient because they were based on these simple shapes – the same shapes that God had supposedly used to create the universe – and they were also used for designing the plans and elevations of entire cathedrals. When designing a reinforced-concrete shell or timber gridshell today, many factors may affect the geometry of the shape; for example, the shape in plan, the rise, the loading, the desired degree of structural efficiency and, of course, the appearance and the nature of the space the architect wants to create. The type of shape chosen by an architect will depend on how it is created. It might be part of a mathematically definable, geometric shape such as a sphere, an ellipsoid, a cone, a toroid, or a hyperbolic paraboloid. Or it may be a natural, form-found shape created

34

BILL ADDIS

using a physical process, such as suspending a chain, net or membrane, creating a soap bubble, inflating an elastic membrane (a balloon), or even crumpling a sheet of paper. In order to analyse the behaviour of a shell structure, it was (until the development of iterative computer programs) essential that the engineer could describe (in mathematical terms, usually as an equation) the geometry of the shape. This is one reason why many barrel vaults have circular or elliptical cross sections, and three-dimensional shells are parts of a sphere, cone, ellipsoid, toroid and so on. Such shapes are also easier to set out on site since the dimensions can be easily calculated. As well as needing to guarantee the safety of a structure, structural engineers are often under pressure to optimize the structure they are designing. Apart from minimizing cost, this might mean designing for minimum weight, or minimizing a certain dimension such as rise or thickness, or making the structure easy to build; for example, by simplifying the geometry. And deep down in the soul of an engineer, there is the intellectual challenge to design for structural efficiency and elegance in ways that reflect the laws of statics and elasticity; for example, designing a beam whose shape reflects the bending moment diagram, or a compression structure such as a concrete shell with a shape that reflects the funicular form. In reality, however, a structure must be designed to carry many different load cases; thus, for example, an ideal funicular shape is not suitable for a real structure – there will always be a need for a shell structure to have some resistance to out-of-plane bending. Nevertheless, in the case of shell structures, determining the funicular shape – or rather the family of funicular shapes corresponding to the many load cases – is an important step in achieving a structurally efficient design.

the available calculation methods were too complex or time-consuming; it would be too costly to build a full-size prototype; it was believed that normal structural analysis methods would not adequately model the structure; the geometry of the structure could not be defined using a mathematical equation; the type of structure was unprecedented; there were no other means available. At an entirely intuitive level, many people believed (and still do) that a small model of a structure would provide some indication of how a larger version of the same structure would behave. For some types of structure, this is indeed the case. Masonry structures are one such category – an arch, a flying buttress or even a fan vault that works in a model will also work if scaled up twenty times to the size of a cathedral. However, there are many other types of structure that cannot be simply scaled up to give a similar structure that works at full size. There are two categories of structural behaviour: that which is independent of scale and that which is not.
4.1.1 Structural behaviour independent of scale

Some structural behaviour is independent of scale and can be scaled up linearly and used to predict full-size behaviour. For example: the statical equilibrium (stability) of compression structures, including masonry arches, vaults and domes; the shape of a hanging chain of weights or net; and, by Hooke’s law of inversion (see Section 1.1), of funicular arches, vaults and domes. For these types of structural behaviour, using models to assist with design is a reasonably straightforward process. A model arch, vault or dome made of cut stones can be a reliable predictor of the behaviour of a similar, full-sized structure. Although we have no convincing evidence, this characteristic of masonry structures explains how they were able to develop so spectacularly, long before any scientific or mathematical understanding of structures. The use of models of this type is discussed in Section 4.2.

4.1

Physical models and real structures

Designers of structures have used small-scale models when it is beneficial to do so, especially in order to raise the engineer’s confidence in the design being proposed. This may have been for one of many reasons. For example:

CHAPTER FOUR: PHYSICAL MODELLING AND FORM FINDING

35

4.1.2

Structural behaviour dependent on scale

Other structural behaviour is dependent on scale and cannot be scaled up linearly. For example: the strength and stiffness of a beam and; the buckling strength of a column or thin shell. It must have been the case, although we have no historical evidence, that ancient builders knew that making models of some types of structure did work as a design process, while for others, it did not. However, they probably did not realize the significance of what they knew. The earliest mention of the nonlinearity of scaling was by Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) who noted what we now call the square-cube law – while area increases with the square of the scale factor, volume, and hence the mass, increase as the cube of the scale. He used this observation to explain that the finite strength of bone material means the size of animals cannot be scaled up indefinitely. Nor did ancient builders realize that what distinguishes the two categories of phenomena is that the first is independent of the structural properties of the materials involved, while the second is not. This was first understood only in the eighteenth century when scientists began to understand and use the concept of elasticity and stiffness.
4.1.3 Models for scale-dependent structures

Concrete shells, more than any other type of structure, and their designers have benefited from using model tests because the structural behaviour of shells is so complex. Not only were the available analytical methods often inadequate, but also the mathematics was complex and either beyond the ability of many designers or too time-consuming to perform within tight commercial constraints. Finally, it should be noted that engineers have never relied wholly on the results of model tests. Test results complement the results of elastic and statical structural analysis, experience gained from previous full-size structures, and a designer’s own feel for structural behaviour which, of course, is often developed using models that bring the forces and deflections into a range that can easily be seen and felt by a person. Each source of information contributes to raising the confidence of the designers to the point where they feel sufficiently confident that their design will deliver a structure that behaves as intended.

4.2

Scale-independent models

For a structure that must be designed to resist bending, such as a real shell or gridshell, many factors need to be taken into consideration when relating the behaviour of the model and the full-size structure, not simply the geometric scale. These may include mechanical properties of the materials in the model and the full-size structure (e.g. density, stiffness, Poisson’s ratio), non-mechanical material properties (e.g. the effects of temperature and moisture) and time-dependent material properties (e.g. creep, viscoelasticity) and, of course, the magnitude of the loads applied. Often it may be necessary to make several scale models of a structure that represent the full-size structure and its behaviour in different ways, in which case the purpose of the model and the test must be carefully decided before making and testing the scale model.

A funicular shape or structure is one formed by a hanging chain or a string loaded with any number of weights. In structural terms, the forces are pure tension and no portion of the structure is subjected to bending. The military and civil engineer Simon Stevin (1548–1620) was one of the first to develop the mathematical representation of forces as vectors. In an appendix (Byvough) to his book De Beghinselen der Weeghconst (The Principles of the Art of Weighing) published in 1586, he illustrated the parallelogram of forces and showed several examples of suspended weights creating funicular shapes in both two and three dimensions (Fig. 4.1). The engineer and scientist Robert Hooke (1635– 1703) worked with Christopher Wren (1632–1723) during the design of St Paul’s Cathedral in London (see page 32) and used his understanding of the inverted catenary, Hooke’s law of inversion (see Section 1.1), to help with the design of the dome. One of Wren’s sketches for the 33m diameter dome shows the shape of a chain suspended over a cross section of the building (Fig. 4.2). This simple model test would have helped raise Hooke and Wren’s confidence that the dome would work satisfactorily as a

compression structure and is the earliest known use of a physical model being used to help determine the form of a structure. At the very least it demonstrated that the catenary arch lay within the masonry which is a general condition for the stability of a dome. Nevertheless, it appears that a uniform chain was used, rather than a series of different weights representing the voussoirs of different sizes. Also, there is no evidence of a three-dimensional hanging model being used, although that would have represented a dome more faithfully. Giovanni Poleni (1683–1761) used Hooke’s principle in the 1740s to assess the safety of the hundred-year-old 41.9m diameter dome of St Peter’s cathedral in Rome, which had developed a number of alarming radial cracks. The original design was for a solid and hemispherical dome, like the Pantheon in

Rome. The artist, architect and engineer Michelangelo (1475–1564) decided the weight had to be reduced and proposed a double-skin dome, like that used by Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1446) at the dome of the Florence Cathedral. Finally, in the 1580s, the design by Giambattista della Porta (1535–1615) increased the height of the dome in order to reduce the outward thrusts at its base and also introduced several iron chains to carry the tensile stresses in its lower part. Poleni was one of several engineers appointed to study the safety of the dome and propose remedial works if necessary. As well as analysing the stability of the dome using statics, he also used Hooke’s hanging chain technique but, unlike Hooke, Poleni’s model had different weights representing the voussoirs of different sizes (Fig. 4.3). Like Hooke, Poleni considered only a two-dimensional arch, but justified this approximation by arguing that the dome could be seen as a series of radial arches, in the form of semilunes (half-orange segments), acting independently of each other. Poleni used the model to determine the ideal shape of the masonry arch and, since the catenary lay safely within thickness of the arch, he concluded that each opposite pair of arches was stable, and hence, so was the whole dome. Nevertheless, he also recommended that additional ties were added to carry part of the hoop stresses. A century later, the German engineer Heinrich Hübsch (1795–1863) also used Hooke’s technique, making hanging-string models to determine the weights of voussoirs needed to achieve the desired shape of an arch or vault shape (Fig. 4.4). Hübsch’s method was used in 1837 for the design of a (roughly) hemispherical dome covering a foundry

able to reduce its thickness to just 175mm for the upper two-thirds of the dome. During the second half of the nineteenth century, a number of books recommended the use of hanging models to establish the best geometry for arches and vaults. In the 1890 (revised) edition of Ungewitter’s classic book on Gothic construction, Karl Mohrmann specifically recommended the use of three-dimensional hanging models. In the 1890s, Friedrich Gösling (1837–1899) also used both two- and threedimensional models for some of his designs (Fig. 4.5). Rather better known is the work of the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926) who used both two- and three-dimensional hanging models made with strings and bags of sand to help establish the forms of arches and vaults for several of his masonry buildings (Fig. 4.6). The most well known of these was the crypt of Colònia Güell (Tomlow, 2011). Gaudí used the results of his model tests to complement his use of both statical calculations and graphical statical methods to determine the forms of the inclined columns and vaults. Heinz Isler (1926–2009) was the last of the great concrete shell builders of the twentieth century, and, like many before him, brought his own unique approach to the challenge. His disarmingly simple idea was to take into three dimensions Hooke’s technique by using a sheet of cloth (rather than a chain) to make hanging models, which he then scaled up to reproduce their funicular geometry at

full size (Figs. 5.2 and 20.13). The results were often breathtaking for their elegance and daring (Fig. 4.7). One technique he developed was to soak a piece of cloth in liquid plaster or resin and allow it to harden; another was to suspend a piece of wet cloth outdoors during in a Swiss winter night to freeze the shape (Fig. 4.8). Not only were these techniques able to generate the form of the main shell, but also the folds that provide stiffening to the free edges of the shells. Isler used other techniques to create both funicular and non-funicular structural forms, including using air pressure to inflate elastic membranes (Fig. 20.8). By these various means, Isler was able to generate forms

whose geometry he could define and whose structural behaviour he could then analyse in detail, using a statical/elastic mathematical model, to determine the appropriate reinforcement needed to achieve the necessary strength, stiffness and resistance to buckling (Chilton, 2000) (see Section 5.3.1 and Chapter 20 for more on Heinz Isler’s work). Frei Otto (b. 1925) has been a great innovator in the use of models to determine the form of tension structures. He began using models in the 1950s as the only way of establishing the form of three-dimensional, membrane and cable-net structures whose final geometry could not, at the time (before computers),

could not be defined using mathematical models. Having established the equilibrium geometry of the tensile structure, it was then possible to use analytical methods to determine in-plane stresses and forces at the boundary supports.

Scale-dependent models

be determined using analytical methods. Since gravity loads played a minor part in establishing the form of the tensile structures, the models themselves were made of membranes or nets with different characteristics: soap bubbles which have a constant surface tension; elastic sheets whose surface tension depends on the strain; and nets whose surface tension arises partly from the elastic extension of fibres, and partly from shear deformations of the net (squares to rhombuses) (see also Section 5.3.1). Otto and his colleagues at the Institute for Lightweight Structures (IL) in Stuttgart developed a large range of modelling techniques, including making soap bubbles up to 1m wide (Fig. 4.9), as well as ingenious methods for measuring and surveying their complex forms which

Models used to study structural behaviour that is scale-dependent were of two main types: those used to study the elastic behaviour of shells loaded in ways which cause out-of-plane bending of the shell; and those used to study the buckling failure of shells due to high in-plane stresses. For the competition for the Sydney Opera House, the architect Jørn Utzon (1918–2008) proposed a roof formed by two thin concrete shells, of undefined geometry, forming a shape that imitated the sails of yachts in the harbour. Various geometries for a thinshell roof were considered and engineers Ove Arup & Partners commissioned structural tests to be undertaken on a 1:60 scale model of an early version (Fig. 4.10). These model tests led to the conclusion that this structural form could not provide sufficient stiffness and strength to carry the various loads that might act upon the roof. During six years of design development, many alternative structural solutions were considered which consisted either of substantial ribs supporting infill ‘shells’ or deeply corrugated shells (Fig. 4.11). A spherical surface was finally chosen to

simplify the construction of the ribbed arches using pre-cast concrete elements, and fixing the ceramic-tile covering to the concrete structure. Ove Arup & Partners were also the engineers for the Bundesgartenschau Multihalle in Mannheim, constructed in 1973–1974 (see also Chapters 12 and 19). The structure of the Multihalle is a form-found timber gridshell, on an irregular plan, covering around 7,400m2. Being of unprecedented size and complexity, it tested the limits of structural analysis and a number of model tests were undertaken to help determine the optimal form for the grid and to supplement the manual and computer analyses. The competition-winning design by the architect Carlfried Mutschler proposed a freeform timber gridshell, about 160m long with the largest shell spanning about 70m × 60m. Working with the architect Frei Otto, engineers Ove Arup & Partners used several different models to determine the overall form, the distribution of stresses in the grid and the best way to erect the structure. Close integration of the manual structural analysis, computer analysis and the results of testing the physical models was essential to meet the great challenges posed by this unprecedented structure (Happold & Liddell, 1975). First, a wire-mesh model, about 1:300 scale, was made to establish the basic form of the structure, consisting of two main halls connected by a linking

tunnel (Fig. 4.12). This enabled a more accurate 1:98.9 scale, hanging-chain model to be built to determine the geometry of the boundary supports that would give the best geometry for the roof. The mesh of hand-made wire links, each 15mm long, was hung from 80 supports whose positions were then finely adjusted to establish the boundary geometry that created the best funicular form, avoiding regions of low tension in the net (Figs. 4.13 and 4.14). The model was then surveyed using photogrammetry, by Professor Linkwitz and his Institut für Anwendungen der Geodäsie im Bauwesen, Stuttgart University, to determine the true geometry of the

modulus one-quarter that of timber. It was loaded with a Uniformly Distributed Load (UDL), on which was superimposed an increasing point load to initiate a local buckling failure. This was repeated with higher UDLs and thus the critical UDL was determined. Four versions of the model were tested – with pinned and rigid (glued) joints between the laths, and with and without diagonal ties. Dimensional analysis (see also Section 8.3) was used to compare the results from the tests on the Essen model and the behaviour of the real Essen shell. This established that the relationship between the model collapse load and full-size collapse load was in proportion to the value of the dimensionless number

shell, and these results provided the coordinate data for manual and computer analytical models (see Chapter 12). As there was no precedent for such a structure on this scale, it was considered essential to test an elastic structural model. However, there was also no precedent for making and testing such a model. It was decided to build and test a model of a similar, smaller gridshell dome that Frei Otto had previously constructed for the German Building Exhibition at Essen in 1962. This would give a better understanding of the behaviour of a gridshell dome, and would test the suitability of the model material and the proposed method of constructing the model, as well as determining the accuracy with which the model was able to replicate the behaviour of the full-size structure. A 1:16 scale model was constructed using laths of 3mm × 1.7mm, at 50mm centres, made of Perspex with a

for model and prototype, where qcritical is the collapse load per unit area, E is the modulus of the material, Ixx the second moment of area, a the spacing between laths, and S the span of the dome. These results demonstrated the benefit of the diagonal cables in inhibiting overall buckling, and also indicated that a double-layer grid would be needed for the larger Multihalle shell. Based on the experience of the Essen model, a 1:60 scale model of the main shell of the Multihalle was constructed in the same manner, using Perspex laths 1.4mm × 2.6mm, at 50mm spacing (Fig. 4.15). The 1m wide model was tested in the same manner as the Essen shell, applying the load using bundles of 100mm nails, each weighing 12.5g. Deflections of the grid were measured using dial gauges, and later

refined by using wires and a lever arrangement to avoid the inevitable friction when a gauge touches the structure. The results were used to validate the results of the computer model and to provide a physical understanding of the nature of the buckling failures in the grid, and the location of critical areas in this complex three-dimensional structure. Testimony to the success of the use of models during the design of this truly remarkable structure is that, despite being proposed as a ‘temporary’ building, it is still standing forty years later, after only one refurbishment in the early 1980s, and is a listed building.

to forget what many of them knew in the 1960s and 1970s – that optimal structural forms do exist, and that they are not parts of a sphere, ellipsoid or (as currently seems prevalent) a toroid. It is surely vital that educators of both engineers and architects continue to use models with the enthusiasm that Heinz Isler did to develop a basic understanding of shells and gridshell structures.

4.4

Models and form ﬁnding in the twenty-ﬁrst century

Physical models are as valid today as they always have been, as a means of creating potential geometries for shell and lattice structures. However, their role is no longer to predict structural behaviour in full-size structures as it was, for example, for the Sydney Opera House or Mannheim Multihalle; this can now be achieved, usually with a sufficient level of confidence, using computer models. Nevertheless, computer models are known to be fallible, due to programming errors or inappropriate assumptions, such as boundary conditions, in the building of the computer model. Physical models can still provide a valuable independent check on the validity of the output of computer programs. While similitude between full-size and model parameters may be slightly inappropriate, they, and the behaviour of the model shell itself, will always be approximately correct; unlike a programming error which may lead to errors of an order of magnitude or more. At the very least, physical models can be used to generate forms that are structurally optimal and that cannot be generated using the normal vocabulary of geometric shapes such as spheres and ellipsoids. A physical model can serve to highlight the degree to which a geometric form deviates from the optimal shape and, hence, how much bending the shell will be required to endure – and the more bending must be resisted, the heavier the structural elements will be. The ease with which computers can generate three-dimensional forms can, however, lead architects

Computational form ﬁnding and optimization
Kai-Uwe Bletzinger and Ekkehard Ramm
Shells are in general very thin structures. This geometrical anisotropy also leads to a physical anisotropy, expressed in load-carrying phenomena such as membrane action, bending and shear. Ideally, shells are optimized structures. They are used when heavy loads have to be carried or large distances have to be spanned. Their exceptionally favourable load-carrying capacity is due to their curvature that allows the shell to be in an almost pure membrane state. In other words, in contrast to bending, each fibre participates equally in the transfer of loads. And if the stress state tends to be homogeneous spatially, the situation is even more advantageous. Of course, these conditions have to reflect the construction material employed. A tension-oriented, thin fabric material has other requirements than a masonry or concrete structure, where compression is the favourable stress state. This ideal situation is based on a number of prerequisites. It is well known that systems optimized with respect to selected parameters may be extremely sensitive to a change in these parameters or even other circumstances not considered. Optimization often is a generator of instabilities and imperfection sensitivities. This is particularly true for thin shells due to their extreme slenderness. Typical examples are buckling phenomena, or sudden failures due to excessive bending. A shell can thus be described as the ‘prima donna’ of all structures. The aforementioned physical anisotropy may lead to a physical sensitivity which almost automatically leads to a numerical sensitivity of simulation models. As a consequence, any sound design has to enable the shell to carry the loads primarily by membrane action to avoid bending, in particular inextensional deformations (see Section 3.1.2). At the same time, the shell needs to be as robust as possible, that is, imperfection insensitive. Most importantly, the design should guarantee these conditions for the entire lifetime of the structure. This ideal situation depends of course on the usual design parameters, such as loads and their combinations, boundary conditions, and the material layout. It is obvious that the shape of a shell plays a dominant role in this design process. In this chapter, the geometry of the shell surface is synonymous either to form, usually used in the context of form finding, or to shape, as it is introduced in the community of optimization. It should be mentioned that in certain cases the design objective might just be the opposite, namely designing a shell for almost pure bending, inextensional deformations, and avoiding any stiffening membrane action. Examples are unfolding processes for space antenna or of plant leaves. Shells can handle different loads by membrane action only if certain conditions are met, but this is

46

of course not always the case. In the first half of the twentieth century, contrary to earlier centuries, roof shells were mainly based on pure, so-called geometrical shapes. These are shapes defined by elementary analytical formulae, such as spheres, cylinders, elliptic paraboloids and hyperboloic paraboloids. One reason of course was that geometrical shapes could be handled by analytical shell analysis. These classical shapes do not usually lead to a proper membraneoriented response. Consequently, extra elements such as edge beams, stiffeners and prestressing had to be introduced. However, shape is a key parameter for the aesthetical appearance and can play a decisive role in the final design. This is particularly true in the context of shell roofs and meant that, contrary to the above-mentioned procedure where the response of a structure is determined for a prescribed shape, an inverse procedure had to be posed. Given a few geometrical parameters, such as span and height, load, desired stress state and displacement limits, look for a natural and mechanically sound shape of the shell, at the same time satisfying the challenges of aesthetic and function as much as possible. It has been shown that in many cases this concept renders more natural and elegant designs with free edges that avoid extra stiffeners such as heavy edge beams. In other words, following the laws of science in an optimal way often leads to an aesthetically pleasing structure. This brings us to the important issue of finding proper forms for thin shells.

buckling, excessive creep, and negative environmental effects are avoided; a reasonable lifetime is guaranteed; and hopefully manufacturing costs are justified; the design is aesthetically pleasing. Here we follow the principle form follows forces – also discussed as force follows form – modifying Louis Sullivan’s famous statement ‘form follows function’ (Sullivan, 1896). The aforementioned requirements and functional needs interact with each other and are in some cases even contradictory, such that a compromise has to be found. It is important to point out that, despite the many constraints governing a design, there is usually not one unique solution. Fortunately, the design space is not limited, allowing enough creativity and design freedom.

5.2

Inﬁnity of design space and design noise

5.1

Objectives for form ﬁnding

From these general statements we want to specify the general objective of an underlying form-finding concept: Find the form and the thickness distribution of a shell for certain functional requirements, such that boundary conditions and all possible load cases are considered; material properties are taken into account (e.g. no or low tension for concrete); stresses and displacements are limited to certain values; an almost uniform membrane state results;

The principal challenge of form finding can be briefly explained by an illustrative example. The task is to design the stiffest structure made from a very thin piece of paper that is able to act as a bridge-carrying load. Because the flat piece of paper is able to only act unfavourably in bending, stiffeners have to be introduced by folding the paper. However, there exist an infinite number of solutions, all of which create stiff solutions of at least similar quality, which are far better than the quality of the initially flat piece of paper (Fig. 5.1). Surprisingly enough, even an arbitrary pattern of random folds appears to be a possible solution, although not being favourable from the manufacturing point of view. The image of the randomly crumpled paper is an ideal paradigm for the infinity of the design space or, more ostensively, the design noise. This terminology indicates an extremely busy design. Together with the expressions ‘filter’ and ‘mode’, it follows the notions in signal processing for generally undesirable, random signals, e.g. white noise. As for the example, the crumpled paper can be understood as a weighted combination of all possible stiffening patterns and one can easily think of a procedure to derive any of the individual basic solutions of distinct stiffening patterns by applying suitable filters to the design noise.

CHAPTER FIVE: COMPUTATIONAL FORM FINDING AND OPTIMIZATION

47

Figure 5.1 Stiffened shell structures made from folded paper: (top left) without stiffening, or with a (top right) coarse, (bottom left) ﬁne, or (bottom right) random stiffening pattern

In a general context, this means filtering out the essential shape parameters that mostly contribute to the objective. In a numerical context, a mathematical filter is chosen to condense the solution to a smaller set of geometrical mode shapes and to reduce the number of design degrees of freedom. This process is denoted as regularization or smoothing. It is clear that the kind of filter as well as the filter process can be freely chosen as an additional and most important design parameter. It is possible to define a procedure, as implied by the paper example, to first filter highfrequency design noise, and second apply geometrical filters. It is, however, also possible to apply indirect filters by pre-selecting and favouring certain classes of solutions in advance, such as a stiffener pattern of certain cross sections and spacing, chosen because of manufacturing or aesthetical reasons. There is no

doubt that the latter approach is the more ingenious one, as a large set of other solutions, perhaps even better solutions, might otherwise be undetected. It is up to the insight and imagination of the designer how to define a procedure of pre-selection, regularization or pre-filtering. Most often, however, this task seems to be a somewhat mysterious one, or a vague one at best. From this point of view, form finding truly is an art.

5.3

Design methods for shell structures

In the following sections, two methods for form finding of shells are discussed that satisfy, at least approximately, the criteria mentioned in the Section 5.1.

48

K AI-UWE BLETZINGER AND EKKEHARD RAMM

In the first method, the shape of a membrane, deformed by a single, dominant load case, or design loading, is determined. An example is a hanging membrane, subject to gravity loads, that is inverted to form the final shape of a roof shell under dead load. This principle of an inverted hanging membrane can be investigated by two different procedures: experimentally, using a real, small-scale physical model, or numerically, using a computer simulation applying large displacement membrane analysis. Depending on the respective physical problem, other design load cases may be investigated; for example, uniform or hydrostatic pressure load. The second method discussed is the most general procedure, namely shape optimization, which can be combined with simultaneous thickness and material optimization. Usually, the overall topology for shells is prescribed by the conceptual design. If, however, the design allows a change of the initial topology – for instance, including further openings or designing the optimal layout of a gridshell – topology optimization as a generalized shape optimization technique can be applied.
5.3.1 Physical and numerical form ﬁnding

The hanging model principle, or Hooke’s law of inversion (see Section 1.1), is known to be one of the oldest form-finding methods for the design of arches and domes that are in pure compression by being free of bending. This principle allowed coping with the low- or no-tension material of masonry as the only available construction material at that time. By inverting the shape of the hanging chain, which by definition is free of bending, an equivalent arch that is in pure compression is obtained. As the structure is free of bending, the material is used in an optimal manner, which means that the structure can also be seen from the point of material minimization or stiffness maximization. For the exploration of the design space, the length of the chain is the one important control handle that defines the final structural height. If the inextensional chain is replaced by an elastic cord, the material properties serve as additional parameters which control the experimental result. The shape of the catenary is uniquely defined by the equilibrium of applied and reaction forces. Here the self-stabilizing

effect of tensile forces in equilibrium serves as the aforementioned filter to detect the preferred result. The situation becomes much more complicated if the hanging principle is applied to the design of domes and shells. The reason is that, due to the second dimension of the surface, there are always multiple possibilities for the forces to flow from the loading region to the supports. In the hanging model experiment, however, there is another very important complication when the one-dimensional chain is replaced by materials with a distinct two-dimensional stress state, which is the additional ability of a membrane to carry load by in-plane shear action. As a consequence, the final deformation of a hanging cloth is dominantly affected by its two-dimensional elastic properties, in particular its in-plane shear resistance. Wrinkles may develop when the structure buckles in compression, at which point the load carrying behaviour is locally reduced to one dimension. The alternative of a woven, orthotropic material of negligible in-plane shear resistance, however, is characterized by the orientation of the fibres. All together, the result of a two-dimensional hanging model experiment for the design of domes and shells is inevitably driven by the material properties and the cutting pattern of the cloth which is used for the experiment. These facts make it difficult to compare results of hanging model experiments with different orientations or types of materials or to explain certain phenomena such as the shape of shells at free edges. Often there is very little, if any, information recorded about the details of the material properties for the hanging membrane, or, even more importantly, the cutting pattern and orientation of material anisotropy. This ambiguity of the material used in hanging models has also to be reflected to the properties of the material of the built structure. The masters of form finding, such as Heinz Isler (see Chapter 20), made superior use of experimentation with different materials and cutting patterns, resulting in seminal structures such as the 1969 Sicli Factory in Geneva (see page 44 and Fig. 20.16). Isler developed very finely tuned procedures with various materials from isotropic rubber to orthotropic textiles, which he carefully tailored for the applications at hand. Figure 5.2 shows examples of completely different shapes obtained by a hanging model experiment, using the same textile, but simply

modifying the angle of anisotropy. This experiment gives important hints about the secrets of this approach. Numerical simulations give similar results, obtained by large deformation finite element analyses with material anisotropy representing the warp and weft properties of a fabric (Fig. 5.2). The element geometry may, but does not have to be aligned to the fibre

orientation. The experiments at Frei Otto’s Institute of Lightweight Structures (IL), University of Stuttgart, nicely show the effect of shear-resistant materials (Fig. 5.3). Hanging forms made from shear-deformable cable nets give clear doubly curved surfaces whereas the shape generated by hanging cloths shows wrinkles and negative curvature at the free edges.

The physical hanging model experiment is an important tool in the conceptual design phase for whatever form-finding procedure will be finally chosen. It not only gives a lot of visual impression but also may provide substantial information for subsequent computer modelling. The numerical hanging models, as well as the optimization concept described in the next section, have the advantage that they automatically provide the geometrical data needed for subsequent structural analyses.

5.3.2 Structural shape optimization

The form finding described above – finding the final shape for a shell for desired or required constraints and objectives – is essentially an optimization process, usually followed in a trial-and-error manner, based on accumulated experience of the designer. A logical progression is to cast this procedure into an automated approach of structural optimization (Fig. 5.4), demonstrated in Part II of this book. The key idea is that the three steps of design, namely the geometrical and material design, the analysis including the sensitivities, and the mathematical optimization, are iterated until the constraints of the problem are satisfied. In the terminology of optimization, these are: the objective(s); the equality and inequality constraints; the upper and lower bounds of the design parameters. The objective, or in multi-criteria optimization the objectives, play the most important role. They may be classical, like minimizing weight or mass, or maximizing the ultimate load causing buckling and/ or material failure, but may also be stress-levelling – getting a more or less homogeneous stress state (fully stressed design) – or minimizing strain energy, which is equivalent to maximizing the stiffness. This last parameter is a very promising objective for shells because it minimizes bending, yielding a membraneoriented design. But further objectives may also be used, such as maximizing ductility and toughness, or avoiding certain frequency ranges. Often, conflicting situations exist, so a compromise solution has to be found that weighs the different objectives.

Three steps of shape optimization

The constraints are the usual design limits for stresses or displacements but may also be a prescribed construction mass/weight, or certain desired or undesired frequencies, just to mention a few. They may be defined as equality constraints (or as soft constraints) in the equilibrium equations. The design parameters may be of different kinds. In the context of shape optimization, they are geometrical parameters controlling the shape and thicknesses of the shell. Thus, these basic features, shape and thickness, are parameterized by shape functions interpolating the initial and subsequently optimized geometry from selected nodal values.

The definition of geometry can be based on concepts with different parameterizations. This section briefly describes the three most common versions. Appendix D includes an explanation of subdivision surfaces.

degrees of freedom for shape optimization and form finding by a few, but characteristic, control parameters of the CAGD model. Interestingly enough, the driving force behind the development of this approach was to find means to treat design and numerical noise as well as to avoid heavily distorted meshes. The solution is to use CAGD design patches and the related shape functions to prevent the high oscillations of numerical design noise. As a consequence, the design space is automatically reduced to the space of the chosen shape functions. The choice of a CAGD model is indeed identical to an implicit pre-selection of a design filter, which directly affects the result. The design patches could be denoted as geometrical macro-elements, which in turn are subdivided by a finite element mesh. Typical representations use polynomial, Lagrangian interpolation, basis splines (B-splines), Bézier splines, or Coons patches as approximations, as shown in Figure 5.5. Usually, C1-continuity between patches has to be enforced. This means that the patches should not only be continuous, but also have a continuous derivative, making them continuously differentiable. For example, applying continuity patches, as shown in Figure 5.5b, generates a surface shape without sudden changes in angle. This, in turn, reduces the number of geometrical parameters due to the constraints of the nodal degrees of freedom of the patches. To demonstrate shape optimization, we use the example of the Kresge Auditorium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston. This reinforced-concrete shell was designed by Eero Saarinen (1910–1961) in 1955 as a segment of a sphere on three supports. The structure, shown

in Figure 5.6, which is certainly appealing from an architectural point of view, is far from optimal with respect to the requirements and objectives discussed earlier. As a result, it needed heavy edge beams and is still today subject to substantial bending. This

suggests that the structure is a candidate for finding a better shape, considering its structural behaviour. The original shape of the auditorium’s roof structure (Fig. 5.7b) was subjected to a process that uses shape and thickness optimization with the objective of minimizing strain energy. Even without an edge beam, an almost pure membrane response in compression (see also Chapter 3) could be achieved. The quality of the modified design, shown in Figure 5.7a, was verified by geometrically and materially nonlinear analyses, and compared to that of the original design. It has to be noted that the initial shell almost collapsed when the scaffolding was lowered; it had to be additionally supported by integrating a column every third mullion. The present analysis for the original shell did not take these extra supports into account. The concrete was modelled with an elastoplastic material model. Geometrical imperfections were also taken into account. Figure 5.7 shows the dead load-displacement response for a representative point of the reinforced-concrete shell. It can be recognized that the original design shows a failure already for the dead load. The load-carrying capacity for the optimized shell without edge beams is substantially higher.

5.4.2

FE-based applying ﬁlters

An alternative to CAGD-based parameterization is the FE-based parameterization. Since in such a model all FE-nodes rather than only a few CAGD-control points can be activated for the shape definition, a huge design space is available. Now, explicit filters are applied for the selection of preferred optimal shapes. The procedure is such that the coordinates and the shape derivative at an FE-node are determined as the weighted mean of all the neighbouring nodes within the filter radius (Firl et al., 2012). Clearly, the filter decides which local optimum will be found from the design noise. As a matter of fact, this technique is based on sound theory and is strongly related to the method of subdivision surfaces (see Appendix D). The FE-based parameterization with filtering is most attractive for form finding and preliminary design because one can find all possible solutions with the same geometric model whereas alternative techniques need laborious reparameterization. Modifying filter functions and sizes is of no effort at all and appears to be most effective for exploring the design space. This is shown by an example in Figure 5.8. The shape of a shell, supported on three points and subjected to selfweight, is to be optimized for stiffness. The ground

plan is fixed, and the thickness is held constant, particularly not allowing for thicker edge beams. Obviously, by simply playing with filters, a large variety of wellknown shapes can be generated: (a) the positively curved shell similar to Otto’s ‘Segelschalen’, (b) the negatively curved edges, well known from many of Isler’s shells, and (c) the Candela-type, hypar-like solution. What is shown here was already obtained by the first few runs in the shortest possible time and serves as a basis for further optimization; for example, to improve the aesthetic quality. In turn, the example may give an impression about how design philosophies can be understood as tools to pre-filter the design space and how they affect the optimal result.
5.4.3 Isogeometric analysis

Usually, geometry is defined in a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) environment; for example, using Non-Uniform Rational Basis Splines (NURBS) as parameterization for the subsequent design. The geometric data are transferred afterwards to the analysts who transform the CAD model into an FE model. The FE parameterization is invoked for both the geometry and the mechanics. Typically, isoparametric finite elements with Lagrangian interpolation are applied. Isoparametric elements use so-called shape functions to represent both (‘iso’ means equal) the element geometry and the unknowns, typically the displacements (see also Appendix A).

More recently, so-called IsoGeometric Analysis (IGA) has been introduced (see for example Cottrell et al., 2009), where the analysis part also uses B-spline and NURBS parameterization. The advantage is, first of all, a consistent concept for both parts of the design. But, the NURBS representation also has a couple of advantages for the analysis part; for example, having a higher continuity between elements for the same order compared to the Lagrangian parameterization. In the context of the design of shell structures, the IGA approach can be looked upon as a generalization of both concepts discussed above, using either coarse design patches or directly a fine finite element mesh for design. NURBS allow what is called knot-insertion to generate series of geometrically identical levels of refined meshes. Typically, the finest mesh is used as the analysis model whereas any of the meshes might be used as the geometrical model for shape optimization. It has to be noted though, that, by choosing one specific optimization model, the design space will be limited. A certain design filter will thus implicitly be applied. The procedure is explained for a cylindrical shell under two opposite concentrated loads (Fig. 5.9). For the geometry of a cylinder with a circular cross section, a simple CAD model based on a NURBS representation with only a few parameters is sufficient, as shown on the left side of Figure 5.9. Based on this exact geometry, a NURBS refinement is necessary to discretize the shell for the mechanical

model, as indicated on the right side. Linear elastic material behaviour is assumed. In the following step, the shape of the structure is optimized with respect to minimizing the strain energy, which is equivalent to maximizing the stiffness. Now, the designer has an almost infinite design freedom, depending on how many parameters are inserted in the NURBS parameterized model to create the geometric model for shape optimization. Two options are indicated in the middle of Figure 5.9. The coarse optimization model in the upper part leads to a shape with two large bulges, increasing the curvature under the two loads. This case could be identified with the approach of applying design patches as described earlier. The optimization model in the lower part uses a very fine geometrical model, used for shape optimization, allowing a much more refined new shape, resulting in a thin ring stiffener. In the extreme case, the fine mesh of the analysis model can be used for the shape optimization as an FE-based parameterization, as mentioned above. In general, the density of the geometry may furthermore vary in different regions of the structure, which essentially replaces the filter described above by avoiding too much geometrical noise. As has been mentioned already, optimization has the tendency to produce structures that are highly imperfection-sensitive. In order to avoid this critical situation, potential imperfections have to be included in the optimization process, that is, the imperfect shell has to be optimized; for example, by maximizing the failure load.

different approaches to parameterize the geometry have been described. No matter which method is applied, it is important to have efficient means to control the design space. Ideally, they are implemented such that they are able to support the designer’s intuition. The designer should always be aware that every detail of the design process affects the result as a design filter. Experimental form-finding methods and, to a limited extent, also their computer simulation have the big advantage of being vivid and ‘real’. They are ideally suited to preliminary design. Shape optimizations are much more general, but at the same time more abstract and sophisticated, and they need a basic design for the initial definition of the optimization problem. If the problem is properly defined, they have great potential. This classification suggests a combination: hanging membranes as a means for the conceptual design stage, and shape optimization for its variation and refinement. However, despite a lot of progress in recent years, one must say that a magical toolbox does not exist. There is still enough room for design freedom and creativity.

Conclusion

Ideal shells are optimized structures that can be extremely sensitive to imperfections, if not properly designed. This means that their shape has to be carefully adapted to the underlying design constraints. In other words, form finding is of utmost importance. This chapter discussed several methods, where the first one was based on the mechanical principle of inverting a hanging membrane. This can be verified either by a physical experiment or a corresponding numerical simulation based on large deformation analysis. A further, more general concept was shape optimization as a subset of overall structural optimization. Three

Force density method
Design of a timber shell
Klaus Linkwitz
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Derive the static equilibrium equations of a single node, with four bar forces and a load applied to it. Explain the consequences of introducing force densities into those equations. Apply matrix algebra and branch-node matrices to generalize this single-node formulation to arbitrary networks. Use the force density method to generate the shape for a shell based on such a network.

The brief
To expand its sports offerings, the municipality of Stuttgart is developing a new sports complex, which includes a swimming pool and an ice rink (Fig. 6.1). Each has to be covered independently to maintain a hot and a cold climate. Both structures are adjacent in order to exchange heat between their heating and cooling installations. For convenient access, both facilities share a central entrance. The Olympic-size swimming pool (25m × 50m) will be naturally ventilated. For this reason, a high-point roof is envisioned,

The use of ‘force densities’ presents an approach for the rapid generation of feasible shapes for prestressed and (inverted) hanging structures. This method allows, especially in the early stages of a new project, the instant exploration of large numbers of alternative, feasible solutions. This chapter explains the basic premise and application of the Force Density Method (FDM), also known as the ‘(Stuttgart) direct approach’. It has been applied to the design of many built structures, particularly to tensioned roofs, but also to the timber shell roofs of the 1974 Mannheim Multihalle (see page 58) and the 1987 Solemar Therme in Bad Dürrheim, discussed in further detail in Chapter 12.

creating a stack effect. The controlled climate for the standard-size hockey rink (30m × 60m) is maintained by a domed enclosure. The client wishes to use locally sourced timber for the main structure, so a timber gridshell is proposed as the structural system.

Equilibrium shapes
Figure 6.2 A prestressed surface, when discretized shows at each interior point, two ‘hanging’ bars curved upwards, and two ‘standing’ downwards

As part of the conceptual design of structures, especially domes, shells and membrane structures, generating an adequate structural shape is crucial to the load-bearing behaviour and aesthetic expression of the design. Their shapes cannot be freely chosen and conceived directly, due to the intrinsic interaction between form and forces. For such a problem one needs form finding. Typical structural systems that require form finding include: soap films within a given boundary; prestressed, or hanging fabric membranes; prestressed, or hanging cable nets; structures generated by pressure (e.g. air, water). Membranes or cable nets can be used for the design of shell structures such as thin gridshells, but are only partially valid as the constituting elements are not necessarily free from bending. For these types of structures, the force density method has proven an invaluable approach to generate equilibrium solutions, and thus feasible shapes for potential designs. Solutions are generated from simple linear systems of equations. Another advantage of using force densities is that they do not require any information about the material for the later realization of the design. As we are dealing with non-materialized equilibrium shapes, no limitations with respect to material laws exist. The materialization follows in a second step. When introducing material, we may choose (independently for each bar in the net) the material, without changing the shape created with force densities.

considering its discretization as a pin-jointed net, at each interior intersection point, two bars are curved downwards, or ‘standing’, and two curved upwards, or ‘hanging’ (Fig. 6.2). This opposite curvature is called ‘anticlastic’ or ‘negative’ curvature. This characteristic doubly curved shape immediately becomes understandable in the following thought experiment. We put up four elastic rubber bands in a box. They will sag under their self-weight and assume the shape of catenaries (Fig. 6.3a). To stabilize these four hanging rubber bands, we place four new ones perpendicularly over them, connecting them at their intersections and attaching them to the bottom of the box (Fig. 6.3b). We now stabilize the net further by applying tension to the bands, by prestressing them. We pull the hanging bands by their ends, located at the sides of the box. Their initial lengths decrease, and as they are lifted up, they pull the net upwards (Fig. 6.3c). We continue by alternately pulling both sets of four elastic bands, as the geometry of the net changes less and less (Fig. 6.3d). Meanwhile, the net itself becomes increasingly stiff, and anticlastic curvature results at every point. Precisely this principle is applied everywhere in a prestressed, structural net.

Looking at any prestressed, lightweight surface structure, we observe that the continuous surface is doubly curved at each point. In other words, when

The thought experiment in Section 6.2 can be further simplified. The stationary, prestressed net is characterized by the fact that at every node equilibrium must exist between the four cable-forces, induced by initial prestress, and any load acting on that node. Let us consider such a single node P0 in equilibrium (Fig. 6.4). The node P0 is connected to fixed points

The four elastic bars a,b,c,d between these points, are connected as pin-joints. In their slack state the four bars are too short to be connected at P0. Consequently, tension forces Fa ,Fb ,Fc ,Fd are generated when they are connected at P0. A fifth force, representing self-weight, is applied as an external load Pz at node P0.
6.2.2 Translation to equations

distance of the nodes to which it is connected. This describes the compatibility between the elongation of the bars and the geometry of the net in the final, prestressed state. 3. The tension forces and self-weight applied to the unsupported node must be in equilibrium. If we translate these three basic facts to mathematical formulae, we obtain the following relationships, for a single node and its four neighbours. First, Hooke’s law of elasticity applies without loss of generality to the changes in length. The tension force Fi , with i = a,b,c,d, in each of the four bars is EA Fi = ___ e . l0 i

Now that we have modelled the prestressed net as a spatial, four-bar, pin-jointed network, the question is how to find a state of equilibrium and the resulting geometry. To this end, we first formulate three basic relationships: 1. Every individual bar is increased in length due to the tension force acting in it. The difference between the non-stretched and elastically stretched length of the bar results from material behaviour. 2. In the prestressed state of the net, every length of an elastically extended bar has to be equal to the P1 a P4 d P0 c pz P3

If the coordinates of the fixed points xk,yk,zk and the unstressed lengths of the elastic bars l0,a,…,l0,d are given, we are now able to determine the unknown coordinates x0,y0,z0 of point P0 and thus its position in three-dimensional space. We have to solve the system of the preceding equations for the unknown coordinates x0,y0,z0. However, this is by no means trivial. The system to be solved is nonlinear as the unknown coordinates x0,y0,z0 are also contained in the lengths la,…,ld , in equation (6.2). Thus, we have to linearize the system, observing that the system is nonlinear with respect to geometry and material.
6.2.3 Force densities

In structural mechanics, the following relationships apply: Static equilibrium requires the formulation of equilibrium equations, which relate external loads and internal forces. In our case, they relate load p to forces Fi in equation (6.6). Material behaviour is determined by constitutive equations relating the internal forces to deformations (more generally, strain) such as elongations and/or curvatures. In this case, Hooke’s law of elasticity (without loss of generality) describes the material relationship (6.1) between forces Fi and elongations ei. Geometry is governed by the compatibility or kinematic equations, relating the deformations to translations. In order to find a solvable system of equations from (6.1–6.6), we carry out a number of substitutions. First, by substituting equation (6.3) into (6.1), we can write EA Fi = ___(l − l0 ) . l0 i

To deal with the nonlinearity of the problem, we introduce force densities, also known as ‘tension coefficients’. These are defined as force in a bar force density = _____________________ . stressed length of the bar Quantities of this type can already be recognized in our previous equations, (6.6) and (6.8). To find the spatial coordinates of P0, we take the following approach to overcome the nonlinearity problem. First, we rewrite equation (6.6) to Fa Fd (x1 − x0 ) __ + … + (x4 − x0 ) __ + px = 0. (6.9) la ld The quotients F/l are declared as new variables q, called force densities, defined as Fi qi := __ li and equation (6.9) thus becomes (x1 − x0 ) qa + … + (x4 − x0 ) qd + px = 0.

The resulting system of equations − (qa + qb + qc + qd ) x0 = − px − (x1 qa + x2 qb + x3 qc + x4 qd ) (6.12)

6.4.1 Branch-node matrix

For each chosen set of four force densities we get a unique solution of the unknown point P0(x0,y0,z0 ) from the linear system of equations (6.13). These unique solutions are equivalent and identical with the solutions of the nonlinear equations (6.6) and (6.8). Notice the equivalence of the equations (6.6) and (6.12), where the former is the nonlinear description, and the latter is the linear description, of the very same equilibrium solution.

6.3

Matrix formulations

So far, we have found a solution if we only have one unknown three-dimensional point in space. Practically, the solution for the single node is by no means sufficient. We are dealing with nets with arbitrary topology and numbers of given fixed and unknown free points. To find solutions for arbitrarily large nets, we have to extend our mathematical tools, and introduce matrix formulations combined with graph theory. In the following sections we discuss some conventions in our notation, then introduce two specific concepts: the branch-node matrix and the Jacobian. Using these, we rewrite the single-node problem in matrix form, before generalizing to arbitrary networks.

Before proceeding to generalize our equations for a single node to those for an arbitrary network, we discuss some fundamental concepts of graph theory that can be used to describe net-like entities and are therefore useful for such a general formulation. In graph theory, a net-like entity consists of an aggregation of n nodes (also called points) and an aggregation of m branches (also called edges). Each branch connects two nodes. The topological relationships between nodes and branches can be described in graph theory by a branch-node matrix C (or incidence matrix CT), consisting of the elements +1, −1 or 0 in each row, so

⎧+1 if branch j ends in node i, Cij = ⎨−1 if branch j begins in node i, ⎩0 otherwise.
A few remarks characterizing the branch-node matrix C: C does not contain ‘geometry’, only topology, that is, there are no metric relationships; there is precisely one element +1 and one element −1 in each row; the matrix is not necessarily regular with respect to

64

its columns, that is, it can have a different number of elements in each column; in the case of a contiguous net, C has the rank m − 1. Now we are able to treat our ‘single-node problem’ using the corresponding branch-node matrix. The branch-node matrix C of the point P0 with its neighbours P1,…,P4 is

and using their diagonal matrices U, V, and W the corresponding bar lengths L = (U 2 + V 2 + W 2)2.

The usefulness of C can be demonstrated by noting that the coordinate differences, u = [x1 − x0 x2 − x0 x3 − x0 x4 − x0 ] , (6.15) are obtained through the multiplication of the coordinate vectors x = [x0 x1 x2 x3 x4 ] with the branch-node matrix C, such that u = Cx. (6.17) (6.16)

To write the equations (6.6) and (6.8) in matrix notation, we also determine the gradient in Euclidean space, or the Jacobian ∂f(x0)/∂x0, of the function

Previously, we had only m = 4 branches and n = n N + n F = 1 + 4 nodes. So long as the m × n branchnode matrix C correctly describes the topology of our network, and consistent indexes are used for all the matrices and vectors describing properties of branches and nodes, equation (6.32) holds for any problem. We apply the same equation to another topology, belonging to that of the net drawn in Figure 6.5.

We want to find the linear system of equations for the determination of the solution. Given that Uq = Qu = QCx, we rewrite equation (6.28) to equations of the form C T QCx + p = 0 N or C T QCN x N + C T QCF x F + p = 0. N N (6.30)

We observe the independence of the equations for the respective coordinate components. For simplicity, we set DN = C T QCN and DF = C T QCF, and obtain the N N system of equations of equilibrium in the form DN x N = p − DF x F, (6.31)

which is a system of linear equations of the standard form Ax = b. This equation linearly defines the free node coordinates x N. This system can be solved efficiently by using, for example, Cholesky decomposition (see Section 13.5.1). With a given load and a given position of fixed points, we get for each set of prescribed force densities exactly one equilibrium state with the shape, now given in three dimensions, x N=D −1(px − DF x F), N yN=D −1(py − DF yF), N z N=D −1(pz − DF zF), N

The example, without external loads, for force densities varying in the edges and in the interior of the net, and the boundary conditions shown in Figure 6.5, leads to the solutions in Figure 6.6. Here the ratio of force densities in the edge to the interior branches is varied from 5:1, 2:1, 1:1 to 1:2, suggesting possible shapes for anticlastic surfaces. When vertical loads are introduced to Figure 6.7a in the range pz = 0.1,0.2,0.5, and the boundary edges are either free or fixed, it yields different, synclastic shapes shown in Figure 6.7b–d.

A net has been determined with ‘pure’ force densities, without any information about the material used for its realization. Subsequently, any materialization of each and every individual bar is possible.

As long as each force F is larger than zero, the denominator of the fraction is always >1 and therefore we have tension in the bar if l0 < l and, vice versa, compression. Furthermore, the initial length l0 of the bar, or cable segment, necessary to realize a given equilibrium shape, is only dependent on the chosen, individual axial stiffness EA.

We know the forces from equation (6.33), where the force densities q are given, and the lengths are calculated for each bar from equation (6.3) using the appropriate coordinates. Then, selecting a diagonal matrix of axial stiffnesses EA, we can calculate the corresponding vectors of elastic elongations e and initial lengths l0. The principle here is to select the initial lengths l0 in such a manner that the elongations e = l − l0, that is, the elongation which is necessary to generate the solution. According to Hooke’s law of elasticity, rewritten and generalized from equation (6.1), e = l − l0 = L0(EA)−1f = L0(EA)−1Lq, q = eEAL −1L−1. 0

The steps in the force density method (Fig. 6.8) are simply constructing the right-hand side of equation (6.32), which consists of the boundary conditions, or fixed points xF, the topology described by C, the force densities q and external loads p. If the resulting solution, described by the coordinates x = [x N x F], is unsatisfactory to the designer, each of these four quantities can be changed to generate a new, unique solution. The loads could also be calculated from the surface area or bar lengths surrounding each node, to approximate self-weight of the structure. For discrete structures, this is done using equation (10.28), while for continuous surfaces, approaches such as those adopted in Chapters 7, 13 and 14 can be used. The effect of particular sets of force densities q on the resulting equilibrium shapes may be difficult to anticipate. Their value can also be determined indirectly: either by the user controlling the horizontal thrust components as in thrust network analysis (Chapter 7), or by adding constraints to form a leastsquares problem (Chapters 12 and 13).

design possibilities by varying the loads p and the force densities q. Because both these parameters are given by the designer, and because their relation (6.28) is linear, one can obtain the same geometry, by scaling both parameters equally. For example, the solution in Figure 6.9a with q = 2 and p = 0.5 also results by scaling the loads and force densities by a factor 2, so with q = 4 and p = 1. In other words, once the geometry is found, one can calculate the real load afterwards and simply scale the force densities accordingly to obtain actual forces in the structure. Figure 6.10 shows a few variations for the swimming pool roof, obtained by changing the boundary conditions (the height and size of the opening in the middle), and by adding point loads to the nodes in Figure 6.10c. The initial topology is radial, with its origin in the centre of the high point. Without providing a load, the resulting forms are anticlastic. The design team settles on the geometries shown in Figures 6.9 and 6.10b for the initial design of the sports complex, shown in Figure 6.11. This design can be materialized and then tested for other load combinations. However, the project may have additional architectural or structural constraints, ultimately expressed in the form of specific positions of nodes, target lengths of branches or values of forces. These constraints lead to a nonlinear FDM, as explained further in Chapter 12.

The Jacobian is the gradient for functions in Euclidean space. It is the matrix of all first-order partial derivatives of a vector- or scalar-valued function with respect to another vector. In other words, the variation in space of any quantity can be represented by a slope. The gradient represents the steepness and direction of that slope.

Conclusion

The force density method is able to generate solutions of discrete networks, through linear systems of equations, that are in an exact state of equilibrium, without needing iterations or some kind of convergence criterion. Applied to the design brief, it enabled us to quickly generate solutions for a given topology, by varying the force densities and external loads. The method, originally developed for cable nets, is, to this day, very common in the design practice of tensioned membrane roofs. By introducing loads, it also allows the form finding of synclastic structures, highly suitable for efficient shell structures. Because the method is entirely independent of material properties, two interesting opportunities arise. First, resulting designs can be materialized arbitrarily, giving the initial lengths of the network in undeformed state, without affecting the final shape. Second, one can simply multiply the loads to any realistic value, and then calculate the internal force distribution, again without changing the geometry.

Exercises
Four points, P1(0,0,0), P2(5,0,3), P3(0,7,3) and P4(7,5,0) are connected to a central node P0 through links a, b, c and d. Each link has a force of 1kN. When a gravity load p = 5kN is applied, determine the position of node P0. Calculate the sum of forces in node P0. What do you observe? Now, determine the position of node P0 once more, except by imposing force densities q = 1 in the four bars, instead of forces. What is the sum of forces in node P0? What happens if the force density q = 2 in bars b and d? Compose a branch-node matrix for the standard example grid in Figure 6.12 and assemble the vectors of force densities q and coordinates x,y,z.

Key concepts and terms
The force density is the ratio of force over (stressed) length in a bar or cable segment. It is also known as the ‘tension coefficient’. A branch-node matrix is a matrix that shows the (topological) relationship between m branches and n nodes. The matrix has m rows and n columns. The entry in a certain row and column is 1 or -1 if the corresponding branch and node are related, and 0 if they are not. The sign depends on the direction of the branch. The transpose of the branch-node matrix is known as the incidence matrix.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Discuss the basic principles of equilibrium analysis for masonry. Relate the key concepts of thrust network analysis to graphic statics and reciprocal diagrams. Implement a simple thrust network analysis solver using linear algebra. Generate funicular shells through explicit control of form and internal force distribution.

The brief
We have been asked to design a pavilion for a park in Austin, TX, USA, that will cover the stage and seating of a performance area of 20m × 15m, providing shade to audience and performers. To design a lasting landmark, we proposed an unreinforced, cut-stone vaulted structure. Using the locally quarried ‘Texas Cream’, a soft limestone, the pavilion would blend into its surroundings. Many important buildings in Austin, such as the State Capitol, have been built with this beige-coloured stone. The pavilion structure stands out from the other buildings though because of its structural use of stone instead of mere cladding. Because Austin, at the heart of Texas, has a very low chance of earthquakes, we can convincingly propose the safe design of an unreinforced stone structure, and a 500-year design life can be guaranteed for the structure, due to the omittance of reinforcement steel.

PREREQUISITES
Chapter 6 on the force density method.

The method presented in this chapter, Thrust Network Analysis (TNA), is appropriate for the form finding of compressive funicular shells, thus particularly for any type of vaulted system in unreinforced masonry. For example, based on TNA but using tile vaulting instead of cut-stone, a full-scale prototype of a ‘freeform’ funicular shell has been built on the ETH campus in 2011 (see page 70 and Figure 7.1). Figure 7.2 shows the form and force diagrams and thrust network of the structure. The colours represent the magnitude of thrust under self-weight in the network’s branches.

of inversion (see Section 1.1). Note that this is of course only considering static equilibrium, and not, for example, instability, such as buckling. Weights, proportional to the self-weight of each stone piece (voussoir), of an arch (Fig. 7.3a) are applied on the vertical lines of action through their centroids, to a hanging string (Fig. 7.3b). When inverted, it produces a thrust line that fits within the arch’s geometry (Fig. 7.3a). This compression funicular can be used to show a possible compression-only equilibrium of the arch.

Hanging models

Before the existence of structural theory, the ancient master builders used design methods for masonry structures based on rules of proportion and geometry. The first scientific understanding of the stability of unreinforced masonry structures was formulated in 1676 by the English scientist Robert Hooke, in the form of the inverted hanging chain: Hooke’s law
6.39 4.9 5.63

For two-dimensional problems, graphics statics can be used instead of a hanging model. It allows finding the form of possible funicular shapes for given loads, but at the same time also the magnitude of the forces in them. The geometry of the structure, represented here by the funicular polygon, is named the form diagram (Fig. 7.3a). The magnitude of force in each element of the form diagram is simply known by measuring the length of the corresponding, parallel element in the force diagram, which is drawn to scale (Fig. 7.3c).

The geometrical and topological relationship between form and force diagram is called reciprocal (Section 7.2.2). An important additional aspect of the force diagram is that it shows both global and local force vector equilibrium of the force in the funicular line (Fig. 7.3c–d). A particular quality of graphic statics is its bi-directional nature, meaning that the form can drive the forces and vice versa. So, if constraints are imposed on the form, such as maximum depth of the structure or given points for the structure to go through, then the forces have to follow; if constraints are imposed on the forces such as upper bounds on the thrust values, then the resulting form will emerge. Controlling either form or force diagram thus allows an informed design exploration. Unfortunately, graphic statics is practically limited to two-dimensional problems. In contrast, physical hanging models allow the ‘analogue computing’ of equilibrium shapes of fully threedimensional networks, although force information of the resulting networks needs to be obtained separately.

7.1.3

Thrust line analysis and the safe theorem

Graphic statics can be used to generate thrust lines, which, when fitted within the masonry structure, visualize possible compressive ‘flow of forces’ through the structure. Jacques Heyman formulated the lower-bound (or safe) theorem for masonry, which states that an unreinforced masonry structure is safe for a specific loading case as long as one compressive solution can be found that equilibrates those loads and fits within the structure’s cross section. Assumed is that the interfaces between the voussoirs (i.e. masonry blocks) provide enough friction or interlocking to avoid sliding failure, and that crushing does not occur (typical historic masonry has stress levels two orders of magnitude smaller than the compressive strength of stone). Most historic masonry structures rely on their thickness to resist live loads, hence combining two stabilizing effects: first, a high self-weight reduces the influence of asymmetric live loading on the resulting thrust line; and second, a large structural depth allows the thrust

74

PHILIPPE BLOCK, LORENZ L ACHAUER AND MAT THIAS RIPPMANN

lines to fit, changing under non-funicular load cases, within the structure’s geometry. An important observation is that a range of possible and admissible thrust lines can be found within the section of a masonry structure; these are all possible equilibrium states in which the vaulted structure could stand. Ideally, thrust lines should be kept within the kern (i.e. the middle-third zone) of the masonry section: as the thrust line visualizes the resultant of the compressive stresses throughout the structure, this means that the entire breadth b of the cross section is then effectively in compression (Fig. 7.4). Theoretically, a resultant force in the middle of the section represents uniform compressive stresses over the entire breadth of the section (Fig. 7.4a), while a resultant force applied at the middle third of the section corresponds to a triangular distribution of compressive stresses, still engaging the entire section (Fig. 7.4b). Going outside the middle third would result in ‘tensile’ stresses, which cannot exist as the masonry structure is unreinforced; the effective breadth b′ of the section is therefore reduced (Fig. 7.4c). When designing a new masonry construction, the central ‘axis’ of the structure thus wants to follow the thrust line under its dominant loading condition, the dead load, typically its self-weight, as close as possible.

a representation of one possible static equilibrium in compression under a given set of loads. Based on the safe theorem, it is sufficient to show that one state of equilibrium exists that fits within the geometry of the masonry vault to guarantee the vault’s stability for that loading case. Buckling, deflection, sliding or other (asymmetric) loading combinations have to be checked separately after the form-finding process. TNA allows for the intuitive design of funicular networks with a high level of control due to the following key concepts: vertical loads constraint (Section 7.2.1); reciprocal diagrams (Section 7.2.2); statically indeterminate networks (Section 7.2.3).

Since only vertical loads are considered in TNA, the equilibrium of the horizontal force components (thrusts) in the thrust network can be computed independently of the chosen external loading. This allows splitting the form-finding process in two steps: solving for an equilibrium of the horizontal thrusts first, and then solving for the heights of the nodes of the thrust network, based on the external vertical loads, the given boundary conditions, and the obtained horizontal equilibrium. Figure 7.5a shows the relationship between the form diagram , which is the horizontal projection of the funicular equilibrium solution, the thrust network G, and the force diagram *, which is the reciprocal diagram of . When referring to elements or properties of the reciprocal, an asterisk symbol (*) will be used.
7.2.2 Reciprocal diagrams

7.2

Method

The three-dimensional version of a thrust line is a thrust network. TNA extends discretized thrust line analysis to spatial networks for the specific case of gravity loading, using techniques derived from graphic statics. Analogously to the two-dimensional case of a masonry arch, the resulting thrust network is not necessarily a rigid structure by itself, but rather

The in-plane equilibrium of , and thus also the horizontal equilibrium of G, can be computed explicitly using its reciprocal force diagram *. Since the diagram is planar, methods from graphic statics allow for the finding of an equilibrium state. Considering as form diagram, each force distribution is represented by a force diagram *, up to a given scale. Form and force diagrams are related by a reciprocal relationship. This means that and * are

parallel dual graphs: branches which come together in a node in one of the diagrams, form a closed space in the other, and vice versa, and corresponding branches in both diagrams are parallel (Fig. 7.5b). Structurally, this means that the equilibrium of a node in one graph is guaranteed by a closed polygon of force vectors in the other, and vice versa. When the closed polygons of the force diagram *, representing the equilibrium of the nodes of the form diagram , are all formed clockwise, then the projected form diagram , and as a result also the thrust network G, will be entirely in compression. The force diagram is furthermore drawn to scale such that the magnitude of the axial forces in the form diagram, and hence the horizontal components of the axial bar forces in the thrust network, can

be found directly by measuring lengths in the force diagram.
7.2.3 Statically indeterminate networks

The static indeterminacy of networks with fixed horizontal projection and subjected to vertical loads can be explained with a geometrical analogy: for a given form diagram, there exist several reciprocal diagrams, that is, dual graphs that satisfy the constraints that corresponding branches are parallel. Because the force diagram represents the horizontal equilibrium of the network, these different, geometrically possible solutions represent different admissible equilibrium states for that form diagram, and consequently the

three-dimensional equilibrium solution for given loading. A three-valent form diagram, such as the one shown in Figure 7.5, is structurally determinate, which means that it has a unique internal distribution of forces, again up to a scale factor, which is clear from its triangulated reciprocal force diagram. Such networks thus only have one degree of freedom: the scale of their force diagram, which is, for the same loading, inversely proportional to the depth of the equilibrium solution. It is thus not possible to redistribute forces in such networks, when their horizontal projection is considered to be fixed. For nodes in the form diagram with a valency higher than three, the network is structurally indeterminate, which means that the internal forces can be redistributed in the structure, resulting in different thrust networks for the given form diagram, but for each given form diagram , force diagram *, and vertical loading P, a unique thrust network G exists (Fig. 7.6). The key strategy in TNA is to give the designer direct control over the distribution of the thrusts in the system. The designer can choose these horizontal forces within the geometric constraints of the reciprocal relationship between form and force diagram. As in graphic statics, both form and force can be manipulated to determine the equilibrium shape. The intuitive force diagrams allow the designer to visually and explicitly distribute internal forces that define the three-dimensional equilibrium shape (Fig. 7.7). Boundary conditions and a solution space can be

imposed on the equilibrium shape, which in turn controls the internal forces.

7.3

Computational set-up

This section introduces the equilibrium equations of the thrust network (Section 7.3.1), the branchnode data structure (Section 7.3.2) that allows for an efficient matrix notation (Section 7.3.3), for use in an implementation of TNA (Section 7.3.4).
7.3.1 Equilibrium equations

The equilibrium of a typical internal node i in G (Fig. 7.8) can be written as FH,ji + FH,ki + FH,li = 0, FV, ji + FV,ki + FV,li = Pi, (7.1a) (7.1b)

where FH, ji and FV, ji are respectively the horizontal components, combining x- and y-components as force vectors, and vertical components of the branch forces coming together in node i, and Pi the vertical load applied at the node. Because the form ( ) and force ( *) diagrams are reciprocal, the branch forces in , hence the horizontal components FH, ji of the axial forces Fij of the thrust network G, are equal to the corresponding branch * lengths l H, ji in *, multiplied with the scale factor 1/r of the reciprocal diagram

are defined as a function of the reciprocal node coordinates. It is thus sufficient only to describe the vertical equilibrium of the nodes of G since their x- and y-coordinates are defined by the choice of a form diagram, , and a horizontal equilibrium of the thrust network is guaranteed to be in equilibrium by the chosen ‘closed’ reciprocal force diagram *. There are thus only nN equilibrium equations needed, one for each free (non-supported) node of the thrust network G.

As in FDM (see Chapter 6), the topology of the thrust network G, and in TNA thus also , can effectively be captured using an m × n branch-node matrix C = [CN|CF]. The m × n* (i.e. m × f, with f the number of spaces in ) dual branch-node matrix C* contains the connectivity information of the reciprocal force diagram *. The branch-node matrix C* of the reciprocal force diagram * can easily be constructed from observation of C. For each j-th column of C*, which corresponds to the j-th space in the form diagram or j-th node of the reciprocal force diagram *, the component c *ij is 1 if edge i is adjacent to the j-th space and is oriented in the same direction as a counter-clockwise cycle around that face in , -1 if opposite, and 0 if the edge is not adjacent to that face. This is shown for a simple network in Section 6.4.1. For the network in Figure 7.9a, the C-matrix becomes

There are several ways that the reciprocal diagram can be constructed from : drawn manually, or equivalently constructed procedurally, which is the approach used for the implementation provided with this chapter (note that this approach only works for small and/or simple networks); automatically generated using an optimization problem (Block, 2009); computed directly by identifying the independent force densities qindep and using algebraic methods (Block and Lachauer, 2013); obtained iteratively by enforcing the reciprocal constraints explicitly on the geometry of and * (Rippman et al., 2012) (see Chapter 13).

The directed graph, shown in Figure 7.9b, was created by assigning directions to all branches of the reciprocal diagram *. The reciprocal diagram was constructed from following the clockwise convention necessary to guarantee a compression-only solution. It can be seen that when following these conventions, all corresponding directed branches in and * are not only parallel but also have the same orientation. This property is a requirement for a compression-only reciprocal.

Matrix formulation

The equilibrium equations (7.5) can be written in matrix form as C T (L −1L *H)Cz − rp = C T (T)Cz − rp = 0. N H N (7.9)

When comparing equation (7.9) with (6.29) in the force density method, it is clear that the force densities q have to be the parameters t relating the lengths of

(7.10)

An important difference with FDM is that in TNA not all force densities q can be chosen freely. Only specific sets of q result in equilibrium solutions for G that have their fixed horizontal projection equal to the form diagram . These possible sets of q correspond to the geometrically allowed reciprocal diagrams, that is, those who respect the parallelity constraints, for . It is possible to identify the independent qindep from the total set of q which can be chosen freely (Block and Lachauer, 2013). By introducing the nN × n matrix D = C T TC, the N nN × nN matrix DN = C T TCN and nN × nF matrix N DF = C TTCF, equation (7.9) can be written as N Dz − r p = DNzN − DFzF − r p = 0, (7.11)

Instead, they need to be found through an iterative procedure, taking at each step the weights proportional to the tributary area of the nodes. Because both equations (7.11) and (7.12) solve fast, this is not a problem. After a thrust network G is found, the axial branch forces s are then obtained directly as
1 s = __Lt, r

where L are the branch lengths in three dimensions.

separating the nN free (non-supported) nodes from the nF fixed (supported) nodes at the boundaries. For a given scale of the reciprocal diagram 1/r and boundary heights zF, one immediately finds, for the chosen and *, the inside geometry zN of the equilibrium network G zN = D −1( pr − DFzF ).

It is also possible to find a solution within given boundaries, zLB and zUB, by formulating equation (7.9) as a linear optimization problem, with as variables all the z-coordinates and the scale factor r min − r

such that

(7.13)

which renders, if a solution exists, the deepest compression-only thrust network within the structural depth of the vault, for the chosen form and (proportional) force diagram, within the given boundaries. The direct approaches in equations (7.11) and (7.12) can be used for problems in which the loading is known a priori. When form finding a shell, that is, the shape of the shell is not known in advance, then the loads due to self-weight are not known a priori.

In Figure 7.10, the general computational design process for forward TNA is illustrated. The formfinding procedure begins with an initial form diagram as user input. Based on the connectivity of the form diagram, the matrices C and C* are generated. In the next step, a reciprocal force diagram * is generated, representing one possible horizontal equilibrium state for G. For simple cases, that is, small networks, this can be done by manually using methods from graphic statics. For more complex networks, this is done using one of the strategies given in Section 7.3.2. Based on * , a feasible set of force densities q is calculated using equation (7.10). Subsequently, the user chooses the heights of the support nodes zF and the scale r. The tributary load for each node is estimated – for example, by using the cells of a Voronoi diagram as tributary load areas – resulting in the vector p (see Section 14.2.3). Based on p, r, zF, q and C, the heights of the unsupported nodes zN are solved; for example, using the simple forward TNA method, from equation (7.11). Based on the topological information provided by C, and the nodal heights zF and zN, the thrust network G can be visualized in three dimensions. This representation enables the designer to examine if the spatial and formal requirements are met. If the result is not satisfying, the form diagram , the internal force distribution, represented by *, the overall scale factor r, or the heights of the supports zF have to be changed iteratively.

Interactive design exploration

This section will go through the design process of the pavilion vault, demonstrating how TNA allows the full control of three-dimensional equilibrium, and thus the ability to steer the form of the compressiononly vault in a very intuitive and flexible manner. The

tool used for this example ensures that the reciprocal relationship between the form and force diagram is enforced during the design exploration and solves for the thrust network. For details about the implementation and algorithms involved, we refer to Rippmann et al. (2012). The design process starts with a simple four-valent grid as a form diagram. Figure 7.11 shows the different design choices step by step, always showing the form (left) and force (middle) diagrams, and the resulting thrust network (right). The grid is generated based on the local (u,v)-coordinate system of a quadrilateral NURBS patch that is drawn by the user. Here, the force diagram is initially generated such that its branches are about equal in length, that is, the horizontal forces in the thrust network are about equally distributed. This choice results in a thrust network with the shape of a ‘pillow’ (Fig. 7.11a). In the subsequent step, a second network patch is added to the form diagram (Fig. 7.11b). The ‘stitching’ of the two patches results in two identifiable parts in the force diagram. The effect of the slight change in direction between the branches of the two subgrids of the form diagram is clear in the force diagram with the separation of the two patches. Longer lengths in the force diagram are equivalent to higher thrusts in the thrust network, which result in a gentle undulation in the equilibrium shape, as forces are being attracted along this line. In the next step (Fig. 7.11c), this effect is exaggerated by attracting more force along the inner edge between the patches. This is done by locally ‘stretching’ the force diagram along that line, without changing the form diagram. As the manipulation does not necessarily preserve parallelity, a diagram is found that satisfies the reciprocal constraints closest to the new configuration. The resulting equilibrium shape now clearly features a crease line. Two new effects are introduced in the following step (Fig. 7.11d). First, the form diagram is deformed such that the angle between the branches at the edge of the two patches increase towards the bottom middle support. The new, enforced ‘flow of forces’, represented by this change in the form diagram results in an accumulation of forces along the edge between the two patches, causing an increasing crease in the thrust network. Second, the top edges of the two

patches are aligned to generate a continuous edge condition. Until now, all edges were considered fully supported. By adding branches to the edge spanning both patches

on the top, an ‘edge arch’ is formed (Fig. 7.11e). This results in the fan-like part in the force diagram. This triangulated part of the force diagram exactly corresponds to the force diagram of a simple funicular arch

in graphic statics (Fig. 7.3c). The geometry of this edge arch in plan is constrained by this part of the force diagram. In addition, the bottom supports are lowered, with the idea of trying to achieve an even more accentuated crease. This action is rejected in the next step by the designer. Shown in the final step (Fig. 7.11f ), all other supported edges are replaced by edge arches except one, added in the same manner as discussed above. The resulting thrust network represents the final design (Fig. 7.12). This design example shows that with TNA an expressive funicular shell can be designed. This is achieved thanks to a controlled exploration of the degrees of freedom of the highly indeterminate, three-dimensional funicular structures. The control parameters were: the form diagram, defining the discretization and the choice of the flow of forces; the reciprocal force diagram, allowing (re-)distribution of the horizontal forces; the scale of the force diagram, controlling the overall depth of the equilibrium solution; the height of the boundary supports; the edge condition, that is, closed, which means fully or partially supported, versus open, which results in a three-dimensional edge arch.

Materials, details and construction challenges

The materialization process of discrete stone vaults begins with the planning and generation of the tessellation, which defines the cut pattern of the structure. Based on this tessellation, the geometry of the individual voussoirs is generated. The subsequent materialization and construction phases include the fabrication of individual elements and the erection of the structure on full in-situ falsework. The overall process is informed by structural and fabricationrelated requirements to ensure structural stability and to minimize material usage, energy consumption and fabrication time.

The tessellation is based on the overall funicular shape of the vault generated with TNA. The resulting thrust network can be seen as an approximation of a continuous compression surface, representing the centre geometry of the vault, excluding the thickness of the structure. The digital representation of this surface is either a NURBS-surface or a very dense mesh geometry, which serves as a target surface for the tessellation. A user-assisted optimization process allows the generation of a feasible pattern on the irregular doubly curved thrust surface, incorporating various, correlated design criteria (Rippmann and Block, 2013). Besides architectural and tectonic considerations, these criteria include structural stability as well as fabrication and construction feasibility. The tectonic expression of the vault is dominated by the topology of the tessellation, which is defined by drawing lines onto the thrust surface or by using assisting tiling strategies. A parallel, automated process guarantees that all lines are as perpendicular or parallel as possible to the local force flow, as the orientation of the tessellation needs to be aligned to the local force vector field to prevent sliding failure between the voussoirs. The force flow is sometimes equated to the direction of steepest descent, the so-called rainflow analogy. The force flow can also be deduced from the results of the TNA form-finding process, by taking the sum of forces in each node, with all the forces oriented

(7.15)

with w = Cz. Furthermore, the prevention of sliding failure and full three-dimensional structural action is achieved using tessellation bonds in which neighbouring discrete pieces interlock. Fabrication and material-related parameters are taken into account by constraining the length of the edges of the tessellation pattern to a specific value, or within a given range, informed by machining limitations and maximum block dimensions. In this assisted design process, the best solution of a tessellation for a given surface, driven by the force flow, edge length restrictions and the topology, is found using an iterative solving algorithm based on a relaxation approach.
7.5.2 Voussoir geometry

through a set of lines normal to the thrust surface, resulting in an alignment normal to the force flow. The resulting contact faces are twisted ruled surfaces (Fig. 7.14). The load-transmitting contact faces should have a flush alignment, and thus also a high geometric accuracy in the fabrication process, in contrast to the upper and lower surfaces of the voussoirs. Circular blade stone cutting fulfils these precision requirements and is at the same time one of the most efficient stone-machining processes (Fig. 7.15). However, to use this technology requires planar cuts. An iterative procedure was thus developed to planarize most contact faces. Computer numerical controlled (CNC) machines with five or more axes are used to process the voussoirs. In contrast to the planar contact faces, the upper and lower surfaces can only be approximated by progressively using parallel cuts tracing the doubly curved geometry.

In a next step, individual voussoirs are generated from the tessellation, the thrust surface and data regarding the local thickness of the structure, which is calculated based on the non-funicular live load cases (see Chapter 13). Each contact face is described by lofting

Structural scale model

Once the tessellation is designed and the voussoir geometry constructed, the structural behaviour of the vault can be tested using a 3D-printed structural scale model. A qualitative understanding of the stability of the vault can be achieved by just manually applying ‘point loads’ to the model (Fig. 7.16). Discrete

structural scale models provide insight into the structural behaviour of an unreinforced masonry structure – and compressive funicular shells in general. Because of the scalability of compression-only masonry structures, which is due to their very low stresses and stability based on their geometry (Heyman, 1995), the models enable a reliable prediction of the stability of a real-scale stone structure for corresponding load assumptions. These unglued, 3D-printed, ‘masonry’ scale models thus serve as convincing validation of the TNA results. By applying point loads and observing the partial and incremental collapse of the scale model, the force distribution assumptions made for the design can be checked directly and possible collapse mechanisms under extreme loading cases (see Section 13.7) can be determined.
