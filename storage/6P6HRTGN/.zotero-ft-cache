Abstract—Compared with plane fracture problem, elasticplastic fracture problem of stiffened plate under bending has its particularity and inevitability for research, and its essence is a three-dimensional fracture mechanics problem. The aim of this paper is to develop a method to analyze bending elastic-plastic fracture of stiffened plates with crack in plate based on Dugdale model, combined with the Paris displacement formula and generalized variational principle, and the three-dimensional fracture problem is transformed into a two-dimensional problem. The Paris displacement formula and generalized variational principle are applied to calculate the displacement of a stiffened plate with central-through crack under uniaxial moment and yield strength in plastic zone. By discretizing stiffened plate into stiffener and plate, the generalized variational principle is combined with deformation compatibility equation to define the node shearing effect of the stiffener. Numerical simulation is carried out by finite element software ANSYS, a procedure for determination of crack-tip plastic zone and crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) has been proposed for stiffened plates with different stiffness, allowing for the existence of a central through crack in the plate, the results from the theoretical model are compared with those of the finite element results. The validity of the developed method is demonstrated by comparing with the FEM results in an illustrative example. It is found that the results from the method agree well with those from the FEM. It is shown that the theoretical model results are reliable compared with those from FEM. The model well reflects the fracture behavior of stiffened plate and the anti-crack property of stiffener; the results have important significance in the low cycle fatigue research on hull structures.

analysis method based on Kirchhoff plate theory is mature and simple, but there is theoretical insufficiency[1-2]; Re issner plate theory improves Kirchhoff plate, and the crack tip stress field can be described better, but the differential equations have higher order, made it more difficult in application. Unlike plane problem, the crack tip stress field changes along the thickness direction. Therefore, the bending fracture of stiffened plate is a three-dimensional fracture mechanics problem[3]. Current research on stiffened plate bending fracture is quite rare. The purpose of this paper is to analyze elastic-plastic bending fracture problems of cracked stiffened plate structure using the Kirchhoff classical plate theory, and to provide the basis for engineering need. In this paper, the Dugdale model used in plane fracture problems was adopted in the bending fracture problems. In Dugdale model[4], the plastic zone is concentrated on the front narrow band of crack tip, the crack direction perpendicular to the direction of crack surface. The plastic zone under yield stress σ Y , the effective crack length 2c = 2 ( a + d ) , d as the length of the crack tip plastic zone, a as crack length; Based on Dugdale model, center cracked stiffened plate elastic-plastic analysis was conducted in the paper. In the analysis, the stiffener is angle-bar, the ends of the plate under uniform moment M 0 ,both ends of the center crack under plastic stress σ Y . The cracked stiffened plate is shown in Fig. 1.

The stiffened plate discussed in Fig. 1 can be separated into plate and stiffeners. The interaction transverse shear stress between plate and the stiffener’s web is approximately replaced by a number of the concentrated forces Q applied to N points, so the shearing forces at the nodes can be solved by the displacement deformation equations for the same nodes. By the superposition principle, plate with central through crack can be decomposed into (i), (ii) and (iii) as shown in Fig. 2.

where: k = ( 3 − ν ) (1 + ν ) , ship structure is a thin plate structure, so it is in plane stress state; u is shear elastic modulus. B. Determination of the node shear force The stiffened plate structure is discretized into cracked plate and stiffener structure, so the stiffener and cracked plate should satisfy the displacement coordination relationship, namely:

kbkx sh( kb) sh( kx) − + ashk ( x − a) − k ( x − a) 2u sh( 2u)

(24)

As shown in figure 2 (iii), N nodes are selected as transverse shear point of stiffener on cracked plate, this is equivalent to Qi on the N nodes of corresponding location; According to the equilibrium condition M xi = Qi ⋅ x , as in[8] ,the stress function of stress intensity factor at the crack tip caused by corresponding node transverse shear Qi is:

Simultaneously solving equations, the corresponding node transverse shear Qi of stiffener on cracked plate can be obtained. By superposition of the Dugdale model, stress singularity does not exist in the tip of central crack of the plate shown in Fig.2.

The following parameters are selected for stiffened plate: Plate length 2L = 1600mm , width 2W = 800mm , thickness t = 5mm , the spacing of stiffener 2S = 400mm .The initial crack length 2a = 80mm . Material parameters: Elastic modulus E = 2.06×105 MPa , Poisson ratio υ = 0.3 , yield stress σY = 235MPa .The stiffness ratio of stiffened plate in Fig.4 are λ = Es As / EWt = 0.1,0.2,0.3, dimensions of T-bar stiffener are 90× 4/60× 4mm , 60 × 4 / 40 × 4mm , 30 × 4 / 20 × 4mm . Es As are respectively the elastic modulus and cross-section area of stiffener. Fig. 5 is the relative moment - CTOD curve, crack length 2a = 240mm , the spacing of stiffener 2S = 800mm , stiffness ratio =0.3, the range of relative bending moment is 1-20.

For simplification of the analysis, the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) of a stiffened plate can be expressed as a CTOD correction form of an infinite cracked stiffened plate, namely:

As can be seen from Fig. 4: 1 Compared with center cracked plate without stiffener, as the increasing of crack length, stiffener effect on CTOD increased with the stiffened plate stiffness ratio; The effect of stiffener reduces CTOD, makes stiffened plate has anti-crack ability. 2 For different crack length, the effect of stiffened plates is different. When the distance between crack tip and stiffener is far away, the corresponding CTOD curve of these three kinds of stiffness ratio are close together, and that effect of stiffener is not obvious. But when stiffener near the crack tip, the corresponding CTOD value of three kinds of stiffness ratio are different. The more of the stiffened plate stiffness ratio, the higher of crack constrain ability. So stiffened plate stiffness ratio has a great influence on the anti-crack properties.

Fig. 3 shows CTOD stiffened plate structure finite element mesh model and the crack tip mesh. In the calculations, the number of intersection points is selected as N = 24 , and this number can make the results tend to stable in the process of analysis.

Fig. 5. The relative bending moment - CTOD curve

As can be seen from Fig. 5, for the external load increasing, CTOD is also increasing, but with a slow rate at the initial stage. The relationship between the external load and CTOD is about the exponential relationship. V. CONCLUSIONS From the CTOD theoretical and numerical analysis of the stiffened plate structure, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1 The elasto-plastic bending fracture analyze for stiffened plates under bending moment can be conducted based on the Dugdale model, and the three-dimensional fracture problem transformed into a two-dimensional problem. This is a new way of research for the low-cycle elastic-plastic fatigue fracture. 2 The analysis method proposed by this paper for evaluating the CTOD of cracked stiffened plates is feasible and reliable compared with the results from FEM, and is realistic to the engineering practice. 3 Stiffener have good anti-crack ability, and stiffened
