Abstract We present an approach to fabricate shell objects with thickness parameters, which are computed to maintain the user-speciﬁed structural stability. Given a boundary surface and user-speciﬁed external forces, we optimize the thickness parameters according to stress constraints to extrude the surface. Our approach mainly consists of two technical components: First, we develop a patch-based shell simulation technique to efﬁciently support the static simulation of extruded shell objects using ﬁnite element methods. Second, we analytically compute the derivative of stress required in the sensitivity analysis technique to turn the optimization into a sequential linear programming problem. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can optimize the thickness parameters for arbitrary surfaces in a few minutes and well predict the physical properties, such as the deformation and stress of the fabricated object.

1. Introduction Three-dimensional (3D) printing is an additive manufacturing technique to physically realize a 3D object from its digital design. The rapid development of desktop 3D printers makes it affordable and easy-to-use for home users, to turn their creative geometry design into reality. To fabricate a desired object, the user needs to create a 3D geometry ﬁrst, typically using commercial modelling software (e.g. Maya and 3DS Max). Such a geometry is usually represented by its boundary surface, which is inﬁnitely thin and cannot be directly printed. To tackle this issue, most 3D printing software either converts the design into a solid object, or extrudes the original boundary surface based on certain thickness parameters, to produce a printable object with an inner hollow volume (which we denote as shell objects). For geometries with non-closed surfaces, converting to solid objects is not an ideal option, as all original holes will be closed (as illustrated in Figure 1). Printing solid objects is also materialand time-consuming. Therefore, users resort to shell objects for fabrication in many applications.

One grand challenge in fabricating shell objects is to guarantee satisfactory structural stabilities of fabricated objects. Recently, researchers have proposed various approaches to improve the structural strengths, including adding inner struts [SVB*12], or embedding frame structures, while saving the printing and support material cost [WWY*13]. For geometries with non-closed surfaces, adding support structures, however, would make the fabricated objects differ from their original designs either visually or functionally. The added support structures can be partially seen or affect how the objects are used. In this paper, we introduce an approach to fabricate shell objects with optimized thickness parameters, which are computed to maintain the user-speciﬁed structural stability without additional support structures. Speciﬁcally, we aim to minimize the shell thickness so that the stress at each vertex of the input surface under given external forces is below the required maximum strength of the designated material. Thus, the ﬁnite element method (FEM) is integrated to simulate the static equilibrium of shell objects and compute the stress values. We adopt the triangular shell element in simulation due to that it already incorporates the shell thickness as a parameter

We allow maximal deformation and thickness optimization DOFs at such regions. the original non-linear optimization problem into sequential linear programming problems. To facilitate the sensitivity analysis technique based on the static equilibrium equation constructed for shell objects, a closed-form solution to compute the derivative of stiffness matrix with respect to the thickness parameters is also derived. We develop an alternating optimization algorithm (AOP) to optimize patch and transitional region thickness, respectively, to avoid the numerical instability problem in optimization.

in the strain–stress relationship, which signiﬁcantly facilitates the derivative computation in the optimization. The main technical challenge is that the extrusion of surface according to prescribed thickness values is not a simple geometric operation, since it might lead to self-intersections for concave or thin regions where their thickness parameters should be carefully determined. To avoid self-intersections, we can allow each vertex of the surface to have its own thickness parameter and set up its limits in the optimization. However, such problem setting requires a large number of thickness variables in the optimization. Moreover, due to the local nature of the stress, the maximal stress constraints need to be formulated at each vertex, resulting in a large number of non-linear inequality constraints. These two issues make the entire optimization unstable and signiﬁcantly slow. We develop an efﬁcient algorithm to compute thickness parameters with stress constraints to handle the above technical challenges. It is made possible with three novel features:

Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can optimize the thickness parameters for arbitrary surfaces in a few minutes and well predict the physical properties, such as the deformation and stress of the fabricated object. 2. Related Work Stress-based structure optimization in practical engineering optimizes the shape of a structure for a minimal stress. Comprehensive surveys on the topic can be found in [Din86] and [SINP05]. Shape optimization integrated with FEM analysis was pioneered by Zienkiewicz and Campbell [ZC73] using sequential linear programming. To avoid the over-sized number of non-linear inequalities constraints on stress, global stress measure functions are adopted, such as p-norm, p-mean and Kreisselmeier–Steinhauser (KS) function [YC96, AFB12]. Big p or large penalty coefﬁcients are used to control the peak stress or stress concentration in global measurebased methods. In the optimization with respect to stress constraints, the shapes can be parametrized using splines or other linear combinations of basis functions [BF84], or can be parameterization-free by solving for FEM node positions directly. In the latter case, surface smoothness regularization terms are required to obtain high-quality results [BFLW10, AFB12]. The level-set method was also applied to shape and topology optimization [Xia12]. The FEM analysis integrated in these methods is usually based on tetrahedral meshes. In contrast, our choice of shell element directly takes the thickness as a parameter in stress computation (see Appendix B for details), which facilitates the computation of derivatives required in the optimization algorithm. Although the shell object can also be

We segment an input surface into a number of patches, and each patch is assigned with a single thickness parameter to significantly reduce the optimization variables. However, observing that the regions of high stress values are usually concave, our algorithm chooses to keep full thickness optimization degreesof-freedoms (DOFs) for concave regions. We adopt the fuzzy cut method [Kat03] to segment the surface and extract such regions. Since the method prefers to cut the surface at concave edges, the patches obtained are mainly convex. Thus, the patch boundaries need to be enlarged to include concave regions. Figure 2 illustrates such a segmentation result on a bunny model, where the concave regions are extracted and covered by so-called transitional regions. Each vertex inside transitional regions is assigned an individual thickness parameter to fully allow the deformation and thickness optimization DOFs. Transitional regions also enable a smooth thickness transition between patches. The maximal thickness values for surface extrusion without selfintersections are computed by the extended distance ﬁeld algorithm in [PKZ04]. We adopt the sensitivity analysis technique to compute the derivative of stress with respect to thickness parameters, and convert

modelled by thin tetrahedrons, the number of DOF in shell simulation is less than tetrahedral mesh, since the original surface needs to be grown on both sides and two vertices need to be generated for one vertex in the case of thin tetrahedrons. The reduction of deformation DOFs is also beneﬁcial to our optimization algorithm. Our work is related to the sensitivity analysis technique in [PNCC10] and [AFB12]. The technique has also been recently applied to cloth simulation to fast predict how clothing deformation changes according to the change of the clothing design parameters [UKIG11, XUC*14]. Derivatives of the stiffness matrix with respect to the model parameters have been explored in [BBO*09] and [BBO*10]. In our paper, we derive an analytic formula to compute the derivatives of stiffness entries with respect to thickness parameters. 3D printing receives a signiﬁcant amount of research interests recently. Computer-aided design algorithms, in conjunction with simulation techniques, have been developed to control the physical properties of 3D printable objects, such as deformation [BBO*10, STC*13], articulation [CCA*12, BBJP12], mechanical motion [ZXS*12, CTN*13, CLM*13] and appearance [DWP*10, LDPT13, CLD*13]. The goal of structural stability analysis of the 3D printable design is to detect structurally weak regions and improve its strengths through the shape optimization. To satisfy the stress constraints, Stava et al. [SVB*12] developed stress relief operations, such as hollowing and thickening; Zhou et al. [ZPZ13] proposed a fast linear element–based method to analyse the worst load distribution. Domain decomposition method has also been applied to locally update the FEM entities to fast predict the inﬂuence of shape editing to the structural stability [XXY*15]. In comparison, our algorithm optimizes the thickness of digital thin-shell objects in their 3D printed counterparts. Our work is also inspired by partitioning a 3D model into parts to facilitate its 3D printing. Luo et al. [LBRM12] proposed to segment a large model into small parts so that the parts can be fabricated in the printing volume of a 3D printer. The structural soundness is also an important criteria in their segmentation algorithm. In [VGB*14], the surface of an object to be printed is divided into small shell parts so as to save supporting materials and printing time. A reduced order optimization framework is developed in [MAB*15] to optimize the generation of offset surfaces with varying thickness to improve the mass distribution and static stability of 3D objects. A recent contribution in [HLZCO14] introduced approximate pyramidal shape decomposition to decompose a volume into pyramidal shape which is optimal for fabrication. However, the structural stability is not considered in their algorithm. Shell simulation is widely used in computer graphics to simulate deformation behaviours of thin-shell objects, such as hat, paper and cloth. The deformation energy of thin shell usually consists of membrane and ﬂexural energies. Cirak et al. [COS00] proposed a shell representation of subdivision surfaces, and computed the shell deformation energies according to the local coordinate system formed in the subdivision. Grinspun et al. [GHDS03] used the change of dihedral angle at each edge in a two-manifold mesh as the ﬂexural energy, and achieved realistic simulation results for shell

objects with curved un-deformed conﬁguration. The modal analysis technique has also been applied to achieve real-time simulation [CYWK07]. Thin-shell objects can also be efﬁciently simulated using 3D point clouds [WSG05]. Gu et al. [GLB*06] formulated the shell deformation energy based on a global conformal parameterization of point cloud surfaces. Their method supports the simulation of fracturing effects. The elaston model developed in [MKB*10] signiﬁcantly extends the meshless simulation method in [MHTG05], which uniﬁes the simulation of solids, shells and beams. 3. Computational Model The goal of computational model is to set up the static equilibrium equation of shell objects to calculate the nodal displacements using FEM. Shell elements and linear elasticity with the isotropic material model are adopted to simulate the deformation behaviour, and then obtain the stress distributions for shell objects [Log11]. Shell element: We adopt the Kirchhoff plate bending (KPB) model and the total potential energy method (TPE) [Fel13] in order to speed up calculating the derivatives of stiffness matrix. The KPB model is based on Kirchhoff–Love theory of plates, assuming that the thickness of a plate remains constant during its deformation [Wik16]. The basic geometry of a shell element is shown in Figure 3. Its thickness t is much less than its other dimensions, and the strain along its local Z direction is ignored in shell deformation according to Kirchhoff–Love theory. In our implementation, the shell element is the combination of KPB element and plane stress element. As illustrated in Figure 3, one node in the mid-surface of a triangular shell element embodies ﬁve DOFs {u, v, w, θx , θy }. The ﬁrst two DOFs {u, v} represent the displacements of the nodes on the mid-surface, which is the local XY plane of a shell element. This deﬁnes the plane stress element, to model the on-plane stretch deformation. The Cauchy strain for such stretch deformation can be simply written as: 1 2

Figure 4: Algorithm ﬂowchart demonstrated using a table model. We optimize the input surface in (a) to obtain the extruded surface as shown in (j), by setting the upper bound of von Mises stress to 31.5 MPa. Based on segmentation information as shown in (b), we expand the boundary between segmentations and get transitional regions in red colour in (c). The initial thickness parameter is set to 2.0 mm (f). After iterations applied (g–i), the ﬁnal result is generated (j). The von Mises stresses before and after the optimization are shown in (d) and (e). The optimization results are shown with their deformations under applied external forces. The decreasing optimized thickness values of the same patch on the left wing of the model are labelled on (f–j). The remaining three DOFs {w, θx , θy } represent the plate bending, where w denotes the displacement of shell along the Z direction. The following formula holds: ∂w = −θy , ∂x ∂w = θx . ∂y (2) 4. Algorithm Our algorithm starts with segmenting an input surface into a set of patches, denoted by BS . We then perform region growing along the boundaries of patches to form the transitional regions, which are denoted as BT . The set of BT is for smooth thickness transition of patches and full deformation and thickness optimization DOFs of their covered concave regions. The triangles inside each patch are grouped and will be simulated using shell elements with a uniﬁed thickness. Essentially, the shape of the object is determined by two set of thickness parameters: α, deﬁning the thickness of each patch (α1 , . . . , αns ) in BS , and β, deﬁning the thickness of each vertex (β1 , . . . , βnt ) in BT . The ﬁnal set of thickness parameters, α, β , is optimized with respect to user-speciﬁed external forces and stress constraints. We denote an input surface as M = {V, E}, where {V = vi , i = 1, . . . , n} is the set of vertices on the surface and {E = ei , i = 1, . . . , m} is the set of edges connecting the vertices. Our algorithm searches for the lightest parameters that are able to sustain the external force, while the fabricated object remains visually pleasant. The input surface is extruded towards its outer and inner sides simultaneously with the half of the optimized thickness parameters to form the ﬁnal shell object to be fabricated. 4.1. Thickness parameters determination There are mainly two steps in thickness parameter determination: Initial surface segmentation and thickness parameters assignment, as shown in Figure 4. Initial surface segmentation: We use the fuzzy cut method in [Kat03] to partition an input surface into a number of patches. The algorithm favours segmentation boundaries at concavities. Since concavities usually indicate the separation of two continuous patches, it can approximate the good continuity principle in perceptual grouping [Psy13]. The user is also allowed to improve the segmentation manually. The segmentation step allows us to use different thicknesses at different parts of the surface (i.e. to allocate more materials at critical regions).

Therefore, given {w, θx , θy } at each node, a curved mid-surface is interpolated to model the bending behaviour of a shell. With the deformation DOFs, the components of Cauchy strain tensor of plate bending can be written as [Log11]: ∂ 2w , ∂x 2 ∂ 2w , ∂y 2 ∂ 2w . ∂x∂y (3)

where Kstre corresponds to the plane stress part, which is of size 2 × 2. The plate bending part Kbend is of size 3 × 3. The packed row and column of 0 expand the size of element stiffness matrix 6 × 6 so that the stiffness matrix can be transformed to the global coordinate system. The plane stress part is determined by the {u, v} DOFs at each vertex, and it is calculated by linear element using ﬁrst-order barycentric coordinate as shape functions. The details of the computation of Kbend are described in the Appendix. Finally, by transforming each element stiffness matrix into a global coordinate system, all local element stiffness matrices can be assembled to obtain a global stiffness matrix for static equilibrium simulation. More details are described in [Fel13].

Thickness parameters assignment: Since the difference in thickness parameters at different patches will result in discontinuities in the extruded surface, the transitional region is needed to connect neighbouring patches. We thus grow the patch boundary by merging the triangles adjacent to the patch boundary edges to form transitional regions, which also covers concave regions of the input surface. After transitional region detection, we assign thickness parameters in each region. The patch thickness parameters are deﬁned as {α0 , . . . , αns }. It helps to remain the speciﬁc shape of the patches and reduces the DOFs in optimization process. While in transitional regions, the thickness for each node is necessary to generate a smooth enough extruding surface. Therefore, the node thickness parameters are represented as {β0 , . . . , βnt }. Note that we use an individual thickness parameter for each vertex in transitional regions. However, in the shell element model, each triangular shell element possesses a single thickness. We thus treat the triangle thickness as the average of its three vertex thickness parameters. Using node thickness as optimization variables is more straightforward in the formulation of our problem as shown in next section. Thus, the number of thickness parameters in our algorithm can be counted as ns + nt , where ns is the number of patches and nt is the number of nodes in transitional regions. 4.2. Thickness optimization The goal of thickness optimization is to minimize a set of thickness parameters so that its maximum stress under designated external forces is within the speciﬁed strength limit. By minimizing the thickness parameters, considerable printing time and material cost for shell objects can be saved, while its stress is still within the safe threshold. Problem setting: Suppose that we have partitioned an input surface into patch regions, the objective function of the thickness optimization can then be written as: min KT 0 0 KS UT US

imum stress threshold σmax , which is usually set as the strength limit of the material used in 3D printing. In the theory of continuum mechanics [GS08], the stress state at any point p in a body is deﬁned by a second-order Cauchy stress tensor, denoted by {σij , i = 1, . . . , 3, j = 1, . . . , 3}. However, it is difﬁcult to directly formulate stress constraints using the stress tensor for the reason that the tensile strength for a material is a scalar to measure the uniaxial stress load asserted in mechanical tests. One successful way is to measure whether the maximal principal stress at a vertex reaches the strength limit. However, the computation of principal stress requires the eigen-decomposition of the stress tensor for which it is hard to obtain an analytical formulation. We thus use von Mises stress in our system, which is a scalar deduced from the Cauchy stress tensor [Log11]: σv2 = 1 (σ11 − σ22 )2 + (σ22 − σ33 )2 2

˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ = ( σ 1 − σ2 ) 2 + ( σ 2 − σ3 ) 2 + ( σ 3 − σ1 ) 2 , ˜ ˜ where σ1 , σ2 and σ3 are three principal stresses, i.e. eigenvalues of a ˜ ˜ stress tensor. It can be veriﬁed that the von Mises stress is equivalent to the maximal principal stress under the situation of uniaxial stress loading. von Mises stress can also be viewed as a conservative measurement with negative biaxial stress ratio in fracture mechanics, i.e. when the two largest principal stresses are of different signs [SJ11]. We further relate the Cauchy stress tensor with the displacements variables [Log11]. For instance, the following formula holds for σ11 : ∂u E (1 − ν) +ν (1 + ν)(1 − 2ν) ∂x ∂v ∂w + ∂y ∂z

where {u, v, w} are the displacements along XY Z directions. For a shell element, we ignore ∂w , since it is assumed to 0. ∂z The last constraint on thickness parameters is used to control the variation of thickness parameters in adjacent regions to guarantee the smoothness of the extruded surface, where λj is set to be the cotangent weight, which is widely used in mesh smoothing algorithms [DMSB99]. We use a small positive ζ to relax the surface smoothness constraints, to increase the ﬂexibility of the optimization algorithm. Note that the surface smoothness constraints are only deﬁned at the vertices of transitional triangles, since each vertex has its own thickness parameter. This constraint does not need to be deﬁned at the vertices inside patches, as we grow each patch using the same thickness parameter. The main challenge to optimize Equation (4.2) is that it is a highly non-linear, non-convex problem. First, the entries of stiffness matrices KT and KS are non-linear functions of the thickness parameters. Altering the thickness at the rest shape requires the re-computation of stiffness matrices. Second, the inequality speciﬁed at each vertex to constrain its stress is non-linear with respect to thickness and displacement variables due to the non-linear nature of von Mises stress with respect to σij . Initial value: For shell objects, their thickness should be small compared to their area according to the assumption of the shell

where ti represents the thickness for both patch regions and the nodes in transitional regions, and si the region areas. For vertices on triangles in transitional regions, its area is approximated by onethird of the sum of the areas of the triangles incident to this vertex. The vertex displacements at both regions are represented by vector US for nodes in patch regions and UT for transitional regions. The ﬁrst term in the objective function is designed to minimize the residual force at the static equilibrium. The second term is used to minimize the printing volume, which is approximated by the product of the thickness parameters with the corresponding areas. t min is determined by the minimal thickness available for 3D printing. The ﬁrst inequality constraint says that the von Mises stress σv at each vertex v is required to be lower than a user-speciﬁed max-

We ﬁrst initialize a constant thickness value for a shell object as t d = 0.05rd as the largest thickness for all patches and vertices, where rd is the length of the bounding box diagonal for the model, and then adopt the extended distance ﬁeld method in [PKZ04] to compute the allowable thickness t p for each vertex in the simulation. The maximal thickness value for a vertex is ﬁnally set to be t max = min{t d , t p }. In [PKZ04], the offset surface of the surface original surface is grown by integrating offset surface the movement according to the gradient G ﬁeld of the extended distance ﬁeld, where the self-intersections are avoided since the θd nH gradient will gradually deviate from surH face normal and will be close to zero only in areas at the concave regions. For a point on a concave region, for example, H as shown in the right inset, the ﬁeld line deviates from the normal of the surface nH . Therefore, t p is obtained once θd reaches 10◦ so that the formed offset surface is close to the normal direction to approximate the geometric assumption in shell simulation. For the point G located on a convex region, the extended distance is close to Euclidian distance near the surface, and its gradient at G is still equivalent to normal, as shown by the dash lines of G. In this case, the value of t p can be set as t d . If self-intersections still occur at the offset surface with the computed thickness values, our algorithm reduces the maximal allowable thickness to be 0.9 ∗ t d and restart the thickness computation procedure. The thickness for a triangle used in shell simulation is set to be the average of the thickness values of its three vertices, and the largest thickness value for a patch is set to be the minimal largest thickness parameter of the vertices in the patch region. The initial thickness parameter values (t i ) are set to be t i = t max ∗ 0.8 in optimization to start from a feasible point. We found that our thickness computation procedure can lead to accurate deformation and stress results for the generated shell objects in all our experiments. 4.3. Optimization algorithm To handle the large number of non-linear inequality constraints, we locally linearize the optimization problem in Equation (4.2) with the sensitivity analysis technique, and solve it with sequential linear programming [ZC73, Van01].

Given the current thickness parameters tik and the computed displacements Uk at iteration k, we can compute the derivative of displacements with respect to ti using Equation (11). The derivative ∂σv k (ti ) is ﬁnally computed using Equation (4.2) with the chain rule. ∂t ∂K The derivation of ∂tsys is described in the Appendix. i Alternating optimization procedure: Since the vertex-level thickness parameters only affect its local neighbourhood, the derivatives of stress and surface volume to them are much less than those for patch-level thickness parameters which affect whole patch regions. Taking the car model in Figure 5 as an example, the L2 norm of stress change caused by patch thickness is 104 times bigger than the changes caused by a node in the transitional region, which results in a signiﬁcant difference in derivative magnitude. Such magnitude differences inﬂuence the condition number of constraint matrix from the stress constraints. It will lead to numerical instability in the linear programming and the algorithm fails to converge in high probability. To overcome this issue, we optimize the set of patch thickness parameters α and transitional node thickness parameters β iteratively in two phases. These two phases are alternatively performed until convergence. In Phase 1, we optimize α. Thus, the optimization problem (Equation 4.2) is set as:
n

The thickness parameters for patch regions, α, are calculated in Phase 1. The thickness for nodes in transitional regions β is calculated only in phase 2. To improve the prediction accuracy of the linearized stress constraints, we restrict that the thickness parameters can only be optimized in an interval near their current values in each iteration. The range is set to be half the maximal thickness value at each vertex in the ﬁrst iteration and gradually reduced to its one-tenth in the iterations afterwards. 5. Experimental Results We have implemented our algorithm on a desktop PC with an Intel I7 CPU and 16G memory. We use the primal-dual simplex method in GLPK library (http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk) to solve the linear programming problem and Eigen library (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) for stiffness matrix factorization. The material parameters used in the simulation are listed in Table 1. The algorithm statistics are listed in Table 2. In mechanical tests of the printed 3D objects, a spring scale is used to roughly measure the asserted external forces, whose unit is set to be kilogram (kg). In Table 2, the 3D printing technologies used to fabricate the models in the experiments are also listed. The two columns IV and OV in Table 2 are the initialized and optimized volume of the models to show how our algorithm can be applied to save materials in fabrication. Physical validation: We ﬁrst validate our shell simulation model by comparing the deformation between a real object and the simulation result for a bracelet model extruded with 2 mm thickness, as shown in Figure 6. The real bracelet object is printed using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic material with the fused decomposition modelling (FDM) technique. The simulation parameter of this model is set to be Young’s modulus 3.0e9 MPa and Poisson’s ratio 0.35, to match the material used

Left: the optimized result. Middle: the thickness distributions. Right: the von Mises stress distribution. The max thickness, 1.7 mm, is gained around the max stress region (31.2 MPa).

The simulation parameter for the bracelet model is set to be Young’s modulus 3.0e9 MPa, and Poisson’s ratio 0.35 to match the ABS plastic material used in 3D printing. Top left: the reference model. Bottom left: simulation result. Right: the deformation result of the printed bracelet model. in the 3D printing. Figure 6 shows that the deformed shapes are visually close: The distance between the two ends of the bracelet model after the deformation is almost identical. Second, the improvement of the structural stability using our optimization algorithm is demonstrated using an example of a swirl object, as shown in Figure 9. The optimized swirl object (printed using Nylon and its optimized thickness is 1.2 mm) can support the gravitational force of an average male adult (60 kg), while the unoptimized swirl object (thickness 0.6 mm initially speciﬁed by the user) fabricated using Nylon material is crashed under the same load. Figure 7 illustrates the optimization with different thickness parameters at different regions. The bunny model is partitioned into 10 regions, and the external force is set to be 40 N at the left ear of the bunny model. The initial thickness parameter is set to be 9.0 mm. After the optimization, the thickness of the left ear is

Figure 7: Examples of multiple thickness parameters optimization. The initial thickness is set to be 9 mm, and a 40 N external force is applied to the left ear of the bunny model. Since the ears are in different regions in the thickness parameter determination stage, the thickness of the left ear is optimized to be 1.8 mm to resist the external force. The maximal stress value to be 42 MPa in the optimization. The picture on the top shows the left ear of the printed object is structurally stable under the external force 4.13 kg, equivalent to 40.474 N.

To simulate the support of the gravitational load of an adult of 60 kg, a 600 N load is asserted on the upper surface of this model. The optimized model can support the gravitational load well, while the un-optimized model starts to crash (its maximum stress is 87.08 MPa under the same loads, which exceeds the material strength limit). See the accompanying video for the detailed results.

Table 3: Comparison of the optimization algorithm with and without segmentation. Patch indicates the number of patches derived from segmentation, and opt node represents the number of nodes in transitional regions, where each node is assigned with an individual thickness parameter in the optimization process. TPI is short for time per iteration, and timings are measured in seconds. For optimization process without segmentation, the DOFs represent the degree of freedom in optimization process. If the process is extremely slow and not convergent, the time consumed is tagged as NA.

reduced to 1.8 mm so that the max stress is below the user-speciﬁed maximal stress value 42 MPa. In the mechanical test, it can be seen that the left ear is still stable under an external force around 4.13 kg (which is equivalent to 40.474 N). Also see the accompanying video for this experiment. Another two multi-thickness parameter optimization results are shown in Figures 5 and 8. Time evaluation: The time statistics of the proposed algorithm is listed in Table 3. It shows that the time complexity of assigning individual thickness parameter at each vertex of input surface is much slower than our patch-based optimization algorithm. For large models, optimization without segmentation is even impossible since the iteration is too slow in the evaluation of the derivatives and values of stress constraints to obtain the convergence in a reasonable time. In contrast, our algorithm can produce high-quality results for large models, as shown in Figure 5. Convergence: Figure 10 illustrates the convergence of max von Mises stress value and the shell volume using the AOP using the car model in Figure 5. Since the linear approximation of stress function used in the linear programming, the real stress value might exceed the maximum strength and the shell volume might occasionally rise too, even though the linearized versions of stress constraints are

satisﬁed. As the optimization progresses, the linear approximation is continuously corrected and the algorithm converges to optimal thickness values. The von Mises stress tends to rise in the beginning and ﬁnally converges to a value below 40 MPa, the maximal strength for SLA material. As an comparison, the optimization without AOP fails to converge to optimal value due to the numerical instability problem. In the experiment, the GLPK package continues to report numeral instability issue in the optimization procedure. The surface vibration can be noticed (Figure 5d) to show the unpleasant optimization result without AOP. 6. Limitations and Discussion Our system assumes that the external force is known in the structural stability optimization. However, in practice, the distribution of external force is difﬁcult to be known in advance, except for some speciﬁc designs. One possible improvement is to apply worst-case structural analysis [ZPZ13] and try to improve the structural stability there with our optimization algorithm. The optimal thickness parameters should be related to the segmentation result. Currently, we segment the mesh using concavity measure in fuzzy cut. Although our shell simulation can be viewed as a reduced model and

it is still performed on the whole mesh so that the stress constraints can be well satisﬁed, it is hard to guarantee that the optimization result is globally optimal only using a single segmentation result. It is valuable to perform structural analysis and integrate the analysis result into the segmentation algorithm as in [LBRM12]. Our approach can optimize the thickness parameters for arbitrary surfaces. However, for highly concave regions, such as sharp concavities, the allowable thickness computed by the extended distance function [PKZ04] is probably limited and not enough for a feasible solution. In this case, we pre-process the input mesh using method proposed in [DMSB99] to smooth the shape of the highly concave region to enable larger thickness there. The change is kept small so that the overall shape of the input surface is still maintained. 7. Conclusion We have described a thickness optimization algorithm to generate shell objects with user-speciﬁed stress properties. The advantage of our method is that it can design structurally stable shell objects without additional inner struts or frames. Our algorithm turns the optimization problem with non-linear stress constraints into a sequential linear programming problem, which can be efﬁciently solved even for surfaces with more than hundred thousands of FEM nodes. In the future, we plan to investigate how to apply the sensitivity analysis technique to various 3D printing applications, especially when static equilibrium simulation is required. We now use linear elasticity and isotropic material models in shell object simulations. It is also interesting to explore how to apply anisotropic material models to further improve the FEM analysis accuracy.

Appendix A: Computation of Kbend for Shell Elements Since we are using triangular shell elements, the shape functions used to elaborate strain–displacement relationship are based on barycentric coordinates. Let us denote the 2D coordinates of triangle vertices, i, j, k, by (xi , yi ), (xj , yj ) and (xk , yk ), respectively (see Figure 3), then the barycentric coordinate Li for vertex i can be determined by the following equation [Log11]: Li = ai + bi x + ci y , 2 ai = xj yk − xk yj , bi = yj − yk , ci = xk − xj , = bi cj − bj ci . 2

Lj and Lk are computed similar to Equation (A.1) using i, j, k as positive cyclic permutation. The bending behaviour of a triangular shell element can be determined by {w, θx , θy } at its three vertices, respectively. While deriving the shape functions, one needs to guarantee that the relationship between w and θx in Equation (2) is imposed. In a nutshell, the shape function N can be described by a 1 × 9 vector which is multiplied to the nine bending DOFs deﬁned at the thee triangle vertices to form the interpolation function of the vertical displacement w: ⎤ P1 − P4 + P6 + 2(P7 − P9 ) ⎥ ⎢ −bj (P9 − P6 ) − bk P7 ⎥ ⎢ ⎥ ⎢ −cj (P9 − P6 ) − ck P7 ⎥ ⎢ ⎢ P2 − P5 + P4 + 2(P8 − P7 ) ⎥ ⎢ ⎥ ⎥, −bk (P7 − P4 ) − bi P8 NT = ⎢ ⎥ ⎢ ⎥ ⎢ −ck (P7 − P4 ) − ci P8 ⎥ ⎢ ⎢ P3 − P6 + P5 + 2(P9 − P 8) ⎥ ⎥ ⎢ ⎦ ⎣ −bi (P8 − P5 ) − bj P9 −ci (P8 − P5 ) − cj P9 ⎡ where P = [P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 , P5 , P6 , P7 , P8 , P9 ] is

The computation of the closed-form derivative of the stiffness matrix to thickness parameters is performed in two stages: (1) compute the derivative for each element stiffness matrix; (2) sum the derivatives at corresponding entries in the global stiffness matrix to obtain a polynomial representation of the derivatives used in sensitivity analysis. Suppose that a shell triangle is extruded with a thickness parameter t. For the stretch deformation part for a shell, we have [ZTZ08]: ⎡ 1 E ⎣ v Ds = 2 1−v 0 ⎢ Bs = ⎢ 0 ⎣ ⎡
