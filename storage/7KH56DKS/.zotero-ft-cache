ABSTRACT The objective of the work presented in this thesis is to investigate the behaviour of transverse stiffeners in transversely stiffened girder webs to various combinations of shear and in-plane longitudinal subjected A fully nonlinear finite element package is used to examine stresses. the effect of panel and stiffener geometrical parameters and initial imperfections on the behaviour of the stiffeners. Particular attention is paid to the way in which the various geometrical parameters affect the deflection and stress state of the stiffener and the peak capacity of the stiffened plate. Variation in material yield stress is also considered. The results of capacity varies concludes that As a result, a is proposed. the parametric study demonstrate the way in which panel with stiffener size for a full range of geometries and stiffener bending rigidity is the major design parameter. new design philosophy for the stiffener optimum rigidity

The basis of current design formulations for transverse stiffeners are compared with the results of the current numerical studies. A simple analytical model is then formulated which reproduces the numerical parametric results. The model produced is appropriate for design and is compatible with the clauses within the current British design rules. Examples are given of the use of the design procedure, and the resulting transverse stiffener rigidities are compared with those obtained from the finite element results and w ith existing design methods.

1.1 INTRODUCTION

In steel and composite bridges, plate and box girders are used the bending moments and shearing forces exceed the when the available rolled sections. An efficient design of capacity of these girders requires the use of deep webs to separate the flanges in order to optimize the bending moment capacity of the girder cross section. To reduce the self-weight of the girder, the thickness may be quite small, and often is such that required web the elastic critical buckling shear stress obtained from a first order theoretical analysis is considerably less than the shear yield stress; shear stress usually being the dominant stress component in a web panel. It has been accepted for many years that the web panel has a post-buckling strength in excess of the significant reserve of buckling stress and early 'allowable stress' codes of elastic critical practice acknowledged this by allowing a low safety factor for the design of the web compared with other components(1.107). Consideration of first order elastic buckling theory indicates that increases in critical significant stress can be achieved by employing transverse stiffeners to divide the web into a number of smaller panels. If this theory is used as a basis for the design is normally of web panels, a theoretical minimum rigidity specified; defined (non-dimensionally in terms of the parameter EI ) such that the elastic buckling capacity of the stiffened web 7= aD is approximately equal to that of an individual plate panel Early supported along the line of the transverse stiffeners. 1-1.2) indicated that this theoretical minimum experimental work(l. inadequate even at relatively low stress levels, and rigidity was hence stiffener design was generally based on empirical formulae(l. 3). This is primarily because first order theory takes no account of the influence of initial imperfections. The introduction of limit state methods to the design of steel bridges has highlighted the importance of post-buckling behaviour in slender webs subjected to shear. For this reason, the design of in the new design has been modified transverse stiffeners In the current British Standard BS5400 (Part 3)(1.4), the methods. design of transverse stiffeners is based on the concept of a strut The axial loading acting on the strut arises from the model. destabilizing effects of in-plane and shear stresses, in addition to forces due to tension field action from the post buckled web. It is accepted that the above requirements are safe but it is now

3
considered that the approach is potentially conservative due to an in the representation the destabilizing approximation of components leading to an incorrect formulation for the growth of strut deflections. Rockey et al(I. 5) proposed a plastic design procedure based on stresses and forces evaluated at the ultimate load of the web The stiffener sizes calculated using this method are panels. sufficient to support the ultimate loads acting on them. All the tests used for the basis of the model were, however, on slender webs. His proposal is complicated to apply in design because of the number of parameters involved. Horne and Grayson(1-5) proposed an empirical stiffener rigidity formula based on a parametric finite element study. Although their formula is simple, it cannot provide an appropriate rigidity for any level of shear and in-plane stresses acting on the stiffened plate. In some cases it may be advantageous to reduce stiffener sizes in areas of low stress, even if panel slenderness values are kept constant, although in normal design the size would be kept constant. Their recommendations also came directly from complex finite element analyses. The interpretation of the finite element results was rather subjective and not based on a clearly defined optimisation requirement for the stiffener selection. 1.2 REVIEW of OF STABILITY review PLATE ANALYSIS METHODS

1.2.1 Basis

This section aims to provide an essentially historical background to the development The of methods for plate analysis. presentation is not exhaustive, but emphasis is placed on the more important works and methods of analysis. 1.2.2 Small deflection

theory

The small deflection plate theory, generally attributed to Kirchoff and Love is based on the following assumptions.
1 2) 3) The material of the plate is elastic, homogeneous and isotropic. The plate is initially flat. The thickness of the plate is small compared to its other dimensions.

4
4) 5) 6) 7) 8) 9) The deflections are small compared to the plate thickness. The slopes of the deflected middle surface are small compared to unity. Deformations due to transverse shear are neglected. The deflection of the plate is produced by displacement of to its initial plane. points of the middle surface normal The stresses normal to the middle surface are negligible. The strains in the middle surface produced by in-plane forces can usually be neglected in comparison with strains due to bending.

The small deflection (linear) bending equation for plates was first formulated by Lagrange in 1811(l. 7) but not published until after his death when it was found without derivation in his notes. Bernoulli(I -9) attempted Navier(1-8) also derived it in 1820. term in the bending to include the twisting unsuccessfully The addition of in-plane force terms to the bending equation. later to form the classical small deflection equation was equation, introduced by St. Venant(I-10) in 1883. The bending equation was solved by Navier(1-8) by expressing the lateral load and deflections in double sine series expansions; his solution was only applicable to plates with simply supported edge It was also solved by Levy(I-11) by adding a particular conditions. Although to the solution of the homogeneous equation. solution Levy's method is considered more general than Navier's solution, the former can be applied only for plates with simply supported the loading function for all sections parallel to opposite edges and the direction of the other two edges must have the same shape. The addition of the in-plane force terms to the bending equation allowed the stability of plates to be examined. Many researchers tackled this problem by using several methods, details of which be found in texts(I. 12-1.18). The methods can be classified into can the following categories. Integration

1.2.2.1 Direct

The evaluation of the critical load by integrating the differential plate is compressed of a uniaxially equation of equilibrium by assuming a buckled shape of a sinusodial mode in the achieved direction multiplied by an unknown function in the compression Substitution of this shape in the differential equation gives other. for the unknown function in terms of four integration a solution down four be determined by writing constants which can the boundary along the conditions equations representing

The equations can be written in a matrix form unloaded edges. if the determinant of the have a non-trivial solution and will is zero giving the characteristic equation from square matrix buckling load is deduced. Further details can be found which the in reference (1.15). It is important to mention that with increasing complexity in the boundary conditions and loadings, the geometrical configuration, determination of the buckling load of the plate using mathematical this method becomes progressively more difficult. 1.2.2.2 Energy Methods These methods have been used extensively to obtain solutions. They rely on the use of a good approximation to the deflected form of the plate. There are several variants to the method. In 1891, Bryan(1.6) derived the expression for the strain energy in a plate and used it to analyse the buckling problem. If stored the principle of conservation of. energy is employed on a plate compression, by equating the work done by under uniaxial forces to the strain energy stored in the plate with a external deflected surface of Navier's expression, the exact answer to the load is obtained from the lowest buckling mode. However, critical for complex geometries, a more complicated displacement function the sum of a number of deflection curves is assumed representing in the Rayleigh -RitzO -17) method. Minimization of the potential as of the system leads to a set of homogenous algebraic energy be solved. Since the assumed deflected equations which must is generally not the exact mode, there will always be an shape by following the Galerkin can be minimised error which 18). It is important to mention that the above procedure(I. rely on the deflected shape satisfying each of the methods Problems can arise for which deflection boundary conditions. functions can be produced which will easily satisfy some of the boundary conditions but cannot be derived to satisfy all the For these cases, the Lagrangian multiplier method can conditions. be used. The latter is explained in detail in reference (1.19). 1.2.2.3 Finite Differences The finite difference method for the solution of differential the continuum by a system with a finite equations represents of nodes. It was first formulated by Boole and others in number The representation the nineteenth of consists century.

for the unknown substituting a series of algebraic expressions, in place of the differential functions and their derivatives, The small deflection plate equation is therefore written equations. in terms of a series of linear finite difference equations. Setting the determinant to zero, gives an approximate value of the critical load. This method is more general than the previous methods because various boundary conditions can be easily handled as well A detailed study by Salvadori and as skew plates(l. 20-1.21). Baran(1.22) discusses errors involved in the method and gives the first and second order finite difference for approximations rectangular and oblique coordinates. The small deflection equation for orthotropic plates derived Huber(1.23) has been solved by the finite difference method. 1.2.2.4 Finite by

element method

The finite element method has proved to be the most versatile tool for solving the static and dynamic behaviour of continua. The method has relied on the advancement of computer power in the last two decades for efficient implementation. It extends the displacement for the solution matrix method introduced of into the analysis of structural continua. Since its gridworks introduction in 1955, an increasingly large number of papers and texts have been written on the applications of and improvements to the method(I. 27-1.28). The structural idealization in the case of plates is obtained by the original subdividing continuum into a number of plate elements of various geometrical shapes by intersecting straight or These elements are connected only at their nodal curved lines. lines in such a way that a close similarity between the displacement of the original and substitute structures is obtained. An idealization of this nature assures that if the elements decrease in size the displacement components in the substitute structure will converge to the actual values at the representative points. Mathematically, the finite element representation resembles the Rayleigh-Ritz method in which the displacements have been approximated by the sum of the functions, each multiplied by an These unknowns are determined from the unknown constant. While using the Rayleigh-Ritz minimum potential theorem. method, the assumed series expression describes the total displacement field of the entire plate. In the finite element displacement patterns for each element are method individual

theory

The large deflection (non-linear) equations were developed by 29) in 1910, following Von-Karman(I. original work on the deflections by Kirchoff(l. 30) in 1876. Marguerre(I. 31) modified the equations to take account of initial geometric imperfections in The derivation can be found in standard texts(l. 12-1.14). 1938. Soper(I. 32) derived the large deflection equation for stiffened YUSUff(I. 33) included initial imperfections in his plates and These fourth plate equations. order non-linear orthotropic to solve and few exact solutions are equations are difficult Solutions are only available for simple boundary possible. conditions.

Constrained: The integral of the stress along the edge is zero (the edge force) and the edge is free to move but remains straight. Restrained: The edge is kept straight and a continuous stress distribution results.
Way(I. lateral 34) solved the case of clamped rectangular plates loads using the Ritz method. The equations for a plate under lateral loading were solved by Levy for the 35) and the clamped case(I. 36) using Supported case(I. Fourier series.

Hu et alO. 41) used a very similar approach and imperfections is most important that the effect confirmed of Tamaki(1.42) around the critical stress level. used Galerkin's method to solve more generally the equations for imperfect plates boundary of simply with combinations supported and clamped conditions, Levy's and Coan's work being special case. Yamaki(1.43) confirmed the theoretical results with tests, good agreement being for a plate with found especially all four edges clamped. Galerkin's method was also used by Yoshiki et al(I. 44) in their for combined loadings. Supple(I. 45-1.46) used a Ritzanalysis Galerkin method of solution and investigated the changes in the buckling mode with respect to the prevailing boundary conditions, imperfections geometrical and applied lateral load.

A Ritz method was used by Falconer and Chapman(I.47) to examine the buckling of stiffened plates. They took an infinitely long plate under uniaxial loading and found the critical buckling wavelengths in terms of the orthotropic rigidities. Mansour, using his own formulation large deflection equations(l. 48), of the orthotropic applied the methods of Levy, Coan and Yamaki and presented design charts(I. 49) for wide and square plates under various load combinations. A useful approximate method for solving the large deflection equations is the perturbation approach(I-50). It consists of using truncated power series in terms of a loading parameter for the deflections and stresses. Walker(1-51) used it to analyse simply supported flat square plates under compression with either constrained or unrestrained boundaries and his results compared well with those of Levy and Coan. Later Dawson and Walker(1.52) initial imperfections of the same shape as the buckling added mode and found that only two terms of the power series were Design coefficients were presented for uniaxially and needed. biaxially compressed plates by Williams and Walker(I. 52). Finite differences have been used by many investigators. The earliest use of this method appears to be due to Kaiser(1.54) who solved the case of a simply supported plate under lateral loading with zero stresses on the boundaries. Wang(1.55) also solved the case of laterally loaded plate and solved the finite difference He extended the analysis equations by successive approximations.

Scholes and lateral and in-plane loading(l. 56). to combined 57) used an energy method to solve the finite Bernstein(I. loading difference for plates under lateral and equations the results very well with experiments. Also, using an correlated energy solution method, Basu and Chapman(1.58) investigated the large deflection behaviour of laterally loaded stiffened plates Soper's formulation(I. 32). Aalami(I. 59) extended Basu and using Chapman's work to cover loading cases using Gaussian reduction to the bending and in-plane parts of the large solve iteratively deflection equations. Design curves were presented(I. 60-1.61). However, using this solution technique the post critical path cannot be followed due to numerical instability(I. 62). A technique The method which overcomes this problem is dynamic relaxation. was first proposed by Day(1.63) and further developed by Otter(I. 64). Its main advantage is in saving computer storage 65-1.66). space(I. The finite element method has been used to investigate the large deflection behaviour of plates and due to its flexibility is a very popular approach. This method forms the basis of the procedure The techniques of the method have been used in this thesis. improved over the years such that the build-up of errors found in is now eliminated(I. 67-1.68). Crisfield(I. 69) has earlier works reviewed the development of the finite element method with application to the analysis of plates and this will not be repeated here.

where be is the width of the compression zone and be is the corresponding effective width. In comparison with uniform compression, two problems arise for this more general case(1.74)

For practical reasons, bc may be measured from the neutral axis of the full section (calculated according to the classical strength of materials). 2) For pure The distribution the effective width bc. of is clearly 0.5bc along each compression, the distribution longitudinal edge.

1 Prior to buckling, the stress is essentially a combination of diagonal tensile and compressive components of equal magnitude. After buckling the critical of the panel is reached, the loading is resisted by the development diagonal of membrane tension fields.

The high load carrying capacity of plate girders with slender webs due to tension field action in the post critical range has been discussed by Rode(1.83) as early as 1P16. His theory was never for the design of steel bridges because he adopted a tension used field width of 50tw as shown in figure 1.3 which had not been verified by tests.
Basler(I. 84) presented the first ultimate load method for the failure load of transversely stiffened plate girders. predicting Figure 1.4 shows his proposed collapse mechanism which is based Basler's method assumes that the flanges tests. on experimental of most plate girders are too flexible to provide an anchorage for the tension field and hence neglected any contribution of the flange strength to the ultimate strength of the girder.

However, Fujii did not take into consideration the influence of the flange rigidity upon the position of the internal hinges. 86) proposed another version of and model by assuming a collapse mechanism with no internal hinges. This collapse model is shown in figure 1.6. Chern Ostapenko(I. Fujii's flange

Skaloud(I. 87-1.88) carried Rockey and out a comprehensive flexural study on the influence experimental of the flange the inclination, on width and position rigidities of the diagonal band in a web in shear. As a result, they proposed an plastic ultimate shear model which operates with a beam mechanism (see The tension field direction corresponds to the web figure 1.7). diagonal, whereas its width is controlled by the location of panel intermediate plastic hinges in the flanges.

In the last two decades, the basic models proposed by Basler and Rockey and Skaloud have been modified by a number of from Europe and Japan. The analytical procedure and researchers the accuracy of these proposed mechanism approaches have been and summarized in reference 1.74. Of all the ultimate reviewed load methods of analysis presented to date, the most general and accurate model is that by Rockey, Evans and Porter(I. 89-1.90). It is a modified version of the Rockey and Skaloud proposal by changing the six hinge panel mechanism criterion to a four hinge one which is enough to produce a panel mechanism. This model produces excellent correlation between theory and test results and recommended by many researchers(I-91) and adopted as a was by ECCS committee 9.30.74). A modified version reference method of this method has been adopted by BS54000.4) for girders longitudinal This ultimate load model is stiffeners. without described in detail in chapter four. It is important to mention that the tension field mechanism model is appropriate for web panels commonly used in longitudinally unstiffened plate and box girders because of their stocky nature.

Where vu is the ultimate capacity of the web evaluated from the tension field theory. The interaction between shear and bending in the web is more pronounced when the flexural strength of the flanges is included. After an extensive study, Evans et al(I-90) established that a from a web to a flange failure mode occurs when the value change of applied moment is approximately equal to the plastic moment of resistance provided by the flange plates only, neglecting any from the web. As a result, Evans(I. 94) proposed an contribution interaction diagram between Vult/Vyw and M/Mp (Vyw is the force to produce yielding of web). shear In BS54000.4), the relationship is given as a linear interaction between sets of values of shear force and bending moment.

The design rules for longitudinally stiffened plate and box girders in BS5400 are based on the numerical studies carried out by Harding et al(1.95) and by Harding and Hobbs(1.96) on the ultimate load behaviour of plates subject to in-plane direct and shear stresses.

This supported the conclusions of Scott and Weber(I-98).

The emergence of tension field theories for describing the of web panels loaded in shear in the postcritical range response has led to the development of many stiffener design procedures. The assumed function of the transverse stiffener was to remain effective in limiting panel boundary out-of-plane displacements The ultimate strength until the panel capacity was reached. to tension field models, however, required these stiffeners withstand the vertical components of the diagonal stresses from the web at one end and transfer them to the other end. Section 1.3.2.3 indicated that the first ultimate strength model for plate girders was developed by Basler(I. 84). It was appropriate assumed that the girder flanges are unable to support the postbuckling tension field and consequently only a limited tension field could develop between the transverse web stiffeners. With this model, the transverse stiffeners had to satisfy two criteria. The first criterion 'was to ensure that they had sufficient rigidity The second to preserve the shape of the girder's cross-section. criterion was to ensure a minimum cross-sectional area to resist The axial the compressive components of the tension field. stiffener force Fs, was given by equation (1.19).

Due to doubts about the current design rules for stiffeners in transversely stiffened webs subjected to shear and in-plane direct An elastostresses, the work reported in this thesis was initiated. large deflection finite plastic element program is used to investigate the different parameters that affect the behaviour of stiffeners up to the ultimate capacity of the panels.

26 The aim of this study is to use the results of the parametric study to produce a simple design model which is safe and economic and can represent accurately the physical behaviour of the stiffeners. Emphasis is given to formulating the design procedure in such a way that it can easily be incorporated in a design code of practice. 1.6 SCOPE OF THESIS

A paper of varying yield stress is also considered. the work of the chapter has been accepted for in part 2 of the Proc. Inst. of Civ. Engrs.

Chapter 4 provides comparisons between the finite element the Richmond and Rockey approaches which form the results and basis of the design procedures adopted by BS5400. Chapter 5 introduces a stiffener design approach based on a beam model for stiffened plates subjected to shear. simple Comparisons are made between its results and those of the finite Another paper presenting the approach element analysis. introduced in this chapter has also been accepted for part 2 of the Proc.

CHAPTER 2 THE FINITE ELEMENT PROGRAM AND ITS VALIDATION.

45 2.1 INTRODUCTION

From the methods described in the previous chapter for plate analysis, the finite element technique has been chosen to solve the non-linear system of equations that govern the transversely stiffened plate behaviour under the various in-plane loading types. The effects of large out-of-plane deflections and material non-linearly have been included in the study. This chapter describes briefly the established non-linear finite in conducting the various package, LUSAS, element used Correlation studies have been undertaken parametric studies. with existing analytical solutions as well as available experimental results. 2.2 DESCRIPTION OF THE FINITE ELEMENT PACKAGE

The LUSAS package(2.1) used in the analyses was developed by It is a general purpose engineering Finite Element Analysis Ltd. for linear and non-linear which incorporates facilities system The system is based on the finite element analysis. stress displacement method and contains a comprehensive range of elements and solution procedures for the analysis of most types of problems. The system contains a wide range of both engineering linear and non-linear material models which cover most The support node conditions may be engineering materials. unrestrained, restrained with a prescribed displacement, spring or free. In the analyses, the plate and stiffener geometries were modelled by rectangular isoparametric semiloof shell elements with the mesh configuration shown in figure 2.1. Each element has a total of eight nodes. The corner nodes have three degrees of freedom which correspond to the displacements in three perpendicular directions whereas the mid-side nodes have five degrees of freedom; the two additional degrees of freedom relate to the loof rotations about the edge of the element at the loof points which located at 1143 of the distance from the midside node to the are The corresponding two corner nodes as shown in figure 2.2. element can accommodate generally curved shell geometries with varying thicknesses and anisotropic materials may be specified. The formulation takes account of both membrane and flexural deformations by thin plate theory, and as required shear deformations are excluded. For more details see reference 2.2.

46 The volume approach proposed by Crisfield(2.3) has been used to incorporate the non-linear effects of material plasticity into the finite element model. The stress state is monitored on a number of layers through the plate thickness. Plasticity of each layer is governed by the von Mises yield criterion and the associated Prandtl-Reuss flow rules. The non-linear solution strategies used in the package are based on various schemes of the Newton-Raphson technique. In order to stabilize these iterative techniques, line searches are added to the iteration strategies to modify the equations where the incremental displacements are updated. The convergence of the non-linear equations solution to an acceptable limit is specified by a nonlinear control section, the values of which are very much a matter of experience. For detailed explanation, it is advisable to refer to the LUSAS User ManUal(2.1). 2.3 FINITE ELEMENT PACKAGE

VALIDATION

2.3.1 Introduction Before any numerical analyses could be carried out, it was first necessary to establish the validity of the package and data control as well as to demonstrate that the chosen mesh configuration shown in figure 2.1 would converge to solutions of acceptable accuracy. The eight noded semiloof element was used in all the cases examined. 2.3.2 Analytical

validation

A simply supported unstiffened plate of aspect ratio ý=1.5 and b/t,, = 180 subjected to shear loading has been analysed by Crisfield(2.3) Harding(2.4) In all cases, a and Grayson(2.5). multilayer 'volume approach' was used with Crisfield and Grayson adopting a finite element formulation and Harding adopting a finite difference dynamic relaxation approach. This plate was also analysed with the LUSAS package with the mesh refinement equivalent to figure 2.1. The results with all the data relating to the analysis are given in figure 2.3. The results of Crisfield and Harding are scaled from diagrams in each reference. Two of the cases from the detailed general study provided by Harding et al(2.6), which later formed the basis of the panel rules

47 within the bridge standard were also examined using the LUSAS formulation and are shown in figures (2.4-2.5). Figures (2.3-2.5) indicate that excellent correlation exists and that the average stress-strain responses from the different analyses are very similar. Another correlation study was carried out on a stiffened panel of and plate slenderness X= 240 presented by aspect ratio ý=0.5 The imperfection mode used corresponds to a Grayson(2.4). stiffener mode of an overall half sine curve combined with a panel two half sine waves in each unstiffened panel (denoted mode with by (P5)) and shown in figure 3.5(a). The results of the parametric presented in chapter 3 showed that this mode is critical for study lateral displacement for the aspect ratio considered in stiffener the example. The results of figure 2.6 again demonstrate excellent correlation. 2.3.3 Experimental

validation

Although the analytical validation presented in the previous subsection demonstrates the validity of the finite element it was felt that further validation with experimental package, results would indicate the appropriateness of boundary conditions and loading selection and provide full confidence in using the package for the current parametric studies. As far as plate girder webs are concerned, most recent work has been carried out at Cardiff(2.7-2.9). experimental However, these tests were generally on girders with very slender Rockey et al(2.7) tested eleven stiffened plate girders webs. designed to be identical except for the dimensions of the The aim of these experimental tests was to transverse stiffeners. check the ability of the stiffeners proportioned by their approach to sustain loads up to the failure of the girder. Figure 2.7 shows the layout of the plate girders tested with all the data relevant to Each girder was the two girders analysed (TGV4 and TGV7). loaded by a concentrated load at midspan thus producing a The panels were also constant shear force in all web panels. subjected to a varying coexistent bending moment. It will be seen later in chapter 3 that the stiffened panels considered in this study consisted of two panels with an intermediate stiffener to minimise the extensive computational time. For this reason, in modelling the plate girders, two panels

48 with the eccentric stiffener were taken in order to represent the The semiloof element and the mesh stiffened web of the girder. configuration presented in section 2.2 were used for the for Three different boundary the modelling. conditions longitudinal edges were investigated; restrained, unrestrained and an actual flange boundary which corresponded to the flange dimensions taken from the test. There was no records presented of the web initial imperfections in the tests and therefore initial imperfection mode (P3) which was identified to be critical for this The applied plate geometry was adopted (see section 3.3.3). loading was a combination of prescribed shear and bending

As mentioned above, the web panels and flange geometries for both girders were the same, whereas the material yield stress and the size of the stiffener SA were larger in girder TGV4 compared It was found experimentally that the shear with girder TGV7. capacities of girders TGV4 and TGV7 were 101.5 KN and 94 KN Moreover, it was observed that stiffener SA stayed respectively. in girder TGV4 straight effectively whereas it deflected substantially in girder TGV7 around failure.

The values of the shear capacity deduced from the finite element analyses with the real flange boundaries therefore underestimate the experimental values by 2% for girder TGV4 and 4% for girder TGV7. These results must be considered very acceptable given the lack of data regarding the imperfections in the girders. The lateral displacements of stiffener SA from the analytical results The stiffener the experimental agreed with conclusions. deflections at peak load were 1.21mm for girder TGV4 and 4-74mm for girder TGV7.

No further Cardiff girders were analysed because their high slenderness values placed them outside the scope of the study in this thesis. presented

CHAPTER 3 PARAMETRIC STUDY OF PLATES SUBJECTED TO SHEAR.

3.1

INTRODUCTION

Although extensive theoretical and experimental work has been carried out on transversely stiffened plates subjected to shear and in-plane loadings, the optimisation of transverse stiffener geometries has not received a great deal of attention. For this reason, a series of parametric studies has been performed on 150 stiffened plate geometries subjected to shear loading using the finite element The objective of these package, LUSAS, described in chapter 2. parametric studies was to provide information from which to develop a simple design approach for transverse stiffeners on either plate or box girder webs. In this chapter, the results will be described and in detail to be used later for the validation of the design assessed approach developed in chapter 5. Because of the large number of cases examined, showing all the results in detail would be tedious. A selection of the results is shown in this chapter to illustrate the effect of the different parameters This selection is based around stiffener involved. geometries determined from the design philosophy explained in chapter 5. At the end of this chapter, a table of results is presented of all the cases analysed which confirm the conclusions drawn in the preceding The ultimate sections. shear capacity and the corresponding maximum lateral displacement of the stiffener are given for all the cases examined to provide a data bank for use by other researchers. 3.2 PARAMETERS UNDERSTUDY

3.2.1 Introduction An extensive study was undertaken on plates stiffened by a single transverse stiffener in order to minimise the use of computer time. In fact, for the case of stiffeners sustaining large deflections, this will not result in a lower bound to strength but was deemed adequate for stiffener deflections less than the order of the plate thickness. Likely interaction between adjacent stiffeners, basically still forming The geometric rigid panel boundaries, was considered minimal. boundary type of loading, variables, conditions and initial imperfection forms were varied such that they are typical of those In this section, the different used in bridge structural design. The comparisons and results parameters investigated are described. will be presented in section 3.3.

and

loading

The plate loading has been achieved by means of prescribed boundary displacements rather than applied stress, because it was the true behaviour of considered that this more closely approximated Frieze (3.1)provided a detailed section of the web plate in a girder. a the boundary conditions suitable for plates subjected to study on and in some cases shear loading. compression The boundary conditions considered in this study are shown in figure 3.1. All plate edges were considered to be simply supported in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the web. This means that any provided by the flanges and the adjacent panels rotational restraint The conditions for the top and bottom edges reflect was neglected. These edges were the degree of transverse boundary restraint. as either restrained or unrestrained as shown in figure considered For the unrestrained edges, the unloaded boundaries were 3.1. to develop any transverse stresses, whereas for the unable cases, the edges were kept straight and hence transverse restrained forces could be developed. For both boundary conditions, the shear loading was applied as a tangential displacement (Y = Ss) along the boundaries, while normal u direction displacement along vertical both vertical boundaries was kept zero. The only difference between the restrained and unrestrained loading process is that, for the case, the top and bottom boundaries were specified in restrained terms of a linear variation of the applied shear displacement in order to maintain straight edges throughout the loading process, whereas in the of this displacement no specification was considered The u displacements along top and bottom case. unrestrained boundaries were also taken as zero to represent the axial stiffness of flange elements. The restrained condition, however, was found to the behaviour impose significant and constraint on the stiffener intermediate conditions were needed (actual flange modelling) in order to properly ascertain the effect of a realistically rigid girder flange.
Harding (3.2) considered the behaviour of panels subjected to shear , in-plane that the boundary conditions stresses and concluded and for modelling in this study were the most appropriate adopted practical web panels.

3.2.4 Geometric

properties

In plate theory, plate panels are usually defined by their aspect ratio ý and panel slenderness X. The definition of these parameters differs In the present study, the definitions used by the between codes. British Standard BS5400(3.3) have been adopted Special consideration has been given to seliecting values of and X The values of that are typical of normal design practice. and X are 0.5,1.0,1.5 and 2.0 and 60,120,180 examined and 240 A plate slenderness of X= 60 is extreme for the design respectively. but it provides an interesting limit case because no of webs, is available for a plate under shear loading and postbuckling reserve the forces acting on the stiffener would be expected to differ from those for more slender panels. In addition to the two above parameters different sizes of stiffeners have been examined for every aspect ratio and plate slenderness to identify the stiffener size which satisfies the basic philosophy described later in chapter 5. Simple flat (rectangular) stiffeners have These been used in order to reduce the number of variables. have been proportioned with an outstand depth equal to stiffeners (3.3) in order to prevent their local ten times the outstand thickness buckling before the ultimate capacity of the stiffened plate has been reached. It is an accepted practice to express stiffener dimensions in terms of flexural This approach has been a non-dimensional y. rigidity in presenting the results in this thesis. If the inertia of the adopted is taken about an axis at the face of the web, the stiffener alone flexural rigidity is specified as y.. If an effective width of web is included in the stiffener section, the inertia is taken about an axis passing through the centroid of the effective stiffener area and the flexural rigidity is given the notation 'Yeff. The different parameters that define the geometry of the stiffened plate are shown clearly in figure 3.2.

RESULTS OF THE STUDY

3.3.1 Presentation A considerable amount of data has been obtained from the finite Graphs, tables comprising the parametric study. element analyses have been used wherever possible, not only to convey and contours the results concisely, but also to allow easier comparison. The behaviour of transverse stiffeners in transversely stiffened to shear loading is mainly dependant on the plates subjected * boundary restraints, the type of initial imperfection, aspect ratio, To demonstrate plate slenderness, yield stress and stiffener size. this, the effects of each of the above parameters is considered in separate sections. Comparisons and individually and presented discussion concentrate mainly on the ultimate shear capacity of the the maximum lateral displacement at the stiffener plates and position. 3.3.2 Effect of boundary restraint

As mentioned in section 3.2.2, both restrained and unrestrained boundary conditions have been examined. While it is clear that the boundary is the weaker of the two conditions unrestrained in terms of sub-panel carrying capacity, there was a considered that the greater potential for the development of stiffener possibility tension field forces present in the restrained boundary case might While the in larger deflections and stresses for the latter. result initial thought was to use the more onerous of the two conditions for the design of the stiffener, it was also clearly important to see by how much the stiffener design would differ between the two boundary representations, to see how potentially conservative the resulting design formulation might be. The effects of these boundaries have been investigated on stiffened having plate slenderness of 180 and aspect ratios 0= 0.5,1.0, plates 1.5 and 2.0. This high panel slenderness X was chosen for this study

61
because the importance is most the boundary restraints of pronounced when lateral deflections are large. Figures 3.6 and 3.7 show clearly the influence of these boundary conditions on the behaviour of the stiffened plate in general and the transverse in particular. In these curves, the abscissa represents the stiffener maximum lateral displacement of the stiffener, whilst the ordinate is It can the average shear stress calculated at every load increment. be seen that for every combination of plate geometry, the stiffener and initial imperfection mode have been kept unchanged in both size restrained and unrestrained cases. For aspect ratio 0.5, mode (P5) has been considered, whereas for aspect ratios 0=1.0,1.5 and 2.0, mode (P3) has been chosen. The reason behind that will be described in detail in section 3.3.3, but it should be noted that these initial imperfection modes are critical as far as the design of the stiffener is Furthermore, concerned for the aspect ratios considered. the dimension of the stiffener yý that was selected to demonstrate this from the design effect corresponds to the value determined philosophy. There was a major concern that while the restrained boundary condition is a valid limit condition, the mathematical formulation actually serves to establish an axial strain control on the stiffener which both limits its ability to carry axial loading and also its ability It provides maximum opportunity to deflect laterally. for the reactions from the panel tension field to be distributed along the The true situation is in fact very complex and requires a girder. flange of finite rigidity in order to establish the true forces acting between girder flange and web elements. While it would be possible by some kind of spring system, this would to model the flexibility involve complexities in interpretation. It was therefore decided that a few analyses should be carried out incorporating actual plate girder flanges so that the effect of the flange presence on stiffener stresses and deflections could be examined. Three flange sizes were chosen from a very slender to a moderately stocky member and are expressed in terms of rigidity of magnitudes parameter Mfw 0.000362,0.0029 Figure 3.8 shows that and 0.0232 respectively. increasing flange rigidity actually reduces the central deflection of the stiffener for a given level of web shear and also causes a modest increase in shear strength. It must be noted that the average shear stress is evaluated from the web stress distribution adjacent to the While stiffener and does not include shear carried by the flanges. the interaction between flange and web stresses is complex and varies along the girder, the graph gives a reasonably accurate It can therefore representation of the web and stiffener behaviour. be concluded that any additional deflections resulting from axial forces on the stiffener due to tension field action are more than

62 by a reduction in the transverse bending of the stiffener countered When interpreting the values of Mfw because of flange support. it should be remembered that in practical design there would shown be a level of flange direct stress that would reduce the normally from the flange both in terms of tension field effective restraint forces and transverse stiffener bending resistance. f While the presence o. the flanges is beneficial for stiffener deflection it is also important to examine the stress state of the stiffener to see tension field forces may lead to earlier collapse whether additional the results of figure 3.8 have already indicated this to be although unlikely. Figures (3.9-3.12) show the stress distribution at both the web interface and and also the outstand tip for the unrestrained It is for the three flanges examined. restrained conditions and interesting that with the stiff flange there is a net axial force clearly at the extremes of the stiffener but that the effect is relatively shown localised. The same effect is not evident in the other figures. Closer does reveal an increase, relative to the central outstand examination tension, in the compressive stresses at the centre of the stiffener In order to investigate this, Table 3.1 shows the web. span near span outstand and stiffener/web junction stresses at peak centre capacity for all the cases examined. shear It is apparent from Table 3 that the tension field reaction does .1 have a small effect in increasing the compressive stresses in the stiffener near the web and reducing the tensile stresses at the tip but that a major part of the latter effect is due to a stiffener in stiffener lateral deflection due to end restraint as noted reduction in the context of figure 3.8. The net outcome is a stiffener which lower stresses and deflections the flange rigidity as sustains increases. This leads to the conclusion that the unrestrained boundary condition is conservative for this condition and was taken for the majority of in this study. While this is clearly conservative in cases considered involve major instances, it would be very difficult and some complication to provide a stiffener design formulation that would allow in a suitable way for flange restraint. It is important to realise that the above conclusions may not apply if the sub-panel is significantly more slender. In this case the tension field effects would be expected to be more important and it is that the unrestrained condition would no longer provide a possible worst case for design.

63 It will be seen in chapter 5 that the design proposal formulated uses the panel strengths incorporated in the bridge standard which would the panel to be unrestrained if bounded by a normally consider flange. The imperfection modes mentioned in figures (3.6-3.12) are again found to be critical for the particular cases presented. These those It be looked at in more detail in the next sub-section. modes will be noted that the stiffener sizes selected in fact should also to the design sizes derived from the design formulation correspond in chapter 5 which in simplistic terms correspond to the presented of stiffener to have a negligible effect on the sub-panel minimum size rigid to limit out-of-plane capacity Le that will be sufficiently boundary movements to levels that will not significantly affect panel response. It is interesting to note at this stage that the distribution of stresses along the stiffener with the unrestrained boundary condition is that of a bending form. There is no clear form for the case primarily This has interesting implications on the restrained boundary. of tension field forces which will be discussed later.

Figures (3.16-3.19) illustrate the effects of imperfection mode 240. From both (P3) on plates with 0 =1.5 and X= 60,120,180 and figures, it can be seen that the applied shear displacement sets of plate panel buckling in all cases. Buckles are essentially causes identical in form for plates having the same aspect ratio and initial imperfection mode, whereas their amplitudes increase with plate X. Thus the form of the primary influence of the initial slenderness imperfection mode can be reduced to the study of one plate slenderness for every aspect ratio.

64 a) Aspect ratio 0=0.5

For aspect ratio 0=0.5, the initial Out-of-plane displacement patterns that were considered are imperfection modes (P5) and (P6). The reason for concentrating on only these two modes is the high probability of their existence at this aspect ratio. This followed from a consideration of the effects of the initial imperfection modes on Grayson (3.5) performed a parametric study on 0=1.0. aspect ratio the effects of initial imperfection modes on stiffened plates subjected to shear and also found that the above modes are the most The effects of these modes will be demonstrated on appropriate. plate slenderness X =180. The stiffener size parameter ys = 193.80 is the size identified by the design philosophy presented in chapter 5 to be adequate for this stiffened plate geometry. Figure 3.20 shows the contour of the lateral displacements of the stiffened plate with imperfection mode (P6) at the plate ultimate shear capacity while figure 3.14 shows the contour of the same plate with imperfection mode (P5). The comparison between these two modes below concentrates on their effect on the transverse stiffener deformation. Firstly, for the stiffened plate with mode (P5), the buckles are the form of the imperfection. The two buckles on the consistent with leading diagonal are in sympathy and force the transverse stiffener to deflect in the direction of their displacements as shown in figure 3.14.
For the plate with mode (P6) figure 3.20, an initial negative dimple in the top right corner and a positive one in the bottom left exists These develop further as the web panels buckle. The panel corner. buckles therefore try to displace the transverse stiffener in opposing directions displacement is much and the resulting of the stiffener smaller in this case as shown in figure 3.20.

Reference to all the results clearly shows that the deformation of the is greatest for imperfection transverse stiffener mode (P5) for stiffened plates of aspect ratio 0=0.5 and X= 60,120,180 and 240.

65 Aspect ratio ý= 1.0 Special consideration has been given to choosing the initial imperfection modes that might exist in practice for plates with aspect Grayson's parametric study (3-5) has shown that ý=1.0. ratio imperfection modes (PI), (P2)and (P3) are appropriate for this aspect The ratio and these are shown in figures 3.3(a), 3.3(b) and 3.4(a). effects of these initial imperfection modes will be illustrated for a 120 and stiffener size stiffened web of plate slenderness X= This particular stiffener was again chosen ys = 44.51. parameter because it is the size determined from the design approach presented in chapter 5. Figures (3.22-3.24) represent the contours of the lateral displacements of the stiffened web at the plate ultimate shear The only difference between the plates is the initial capacity. imperfection mode (PI), (P2) and (P3) respectively. If these contours are compared two main points can be noted: The amplitude of the web buckles is a maximum in figure 3.24 with initial imperfection mode (P3)2The lateral displacements of the stiffener are also largest for (P3)imperfection This mode therefore appears to be the critical imperfection mode for this aspect ratio. relevant

The same conclusion can be drawn b r looking at figure 3.25 which shows the relationship between the average shear stress and the maximum lateral displacement in the stiffener for each imperfection form. At any level of shear stress, the lateral displacement V is largest in the stiffened plate having P3 as an initial imperfection mode. C) Aspect ratio 0=1.5 and 2.0.

Figures (3.26-3.29) show the contours of the lateral displacements of stiffened plates having aspect ratio ý=2.0 and panel slenderness X= 60,120,180 The stiffener dimensions chosen for these and 240. in plates are those identified by the design philosophy presented To demonstrate the effects of the initial imperfection chapter 5. If these patterns, mode (P3) has been selected for these plates. contours are compared to the contours of the stiffened plates of aspect ratios 0=1.5 shown in figures (3.16-3.19), it can be seen that the form of the buckles in both aspect ratios is identical for any plate The effect of the imperfection mode on both aspect slenderness. ratios is therefore studied by reference to the 0=1.5 case.

Figure 3.31 compares the relationships between the average shear stress r and the maximum lateral displacement in the stiffener for the two different imperfection forms and confirms that (P3) is more critical for this aspect ratio as for 0=1.0.

3.3.4 Effect

slenderness

Knowledge of the effects of imperfection forms and boundary conditions considerably simplifies the understanding of the effects of both panel slenderness and aspect ratio. In this section, the influence of the plate slenderness on the behaviour of the transverse stiffeners is investigated. Figures (3.323.35) demonstrate this effect on aspect ratios 0.5,1.0,1.5 and 2.0. In all figures the average shear stress r has been plotted against the stiffener maximum lateral displacement. Figure 3.32 shows a comparison between different slenderness values for an aspect ratio ý=0.5 and stiffener dimensions %= 90. Omm and Tý = 9.Omm. The plate slenderness values considered X= 60,120,180 and 240. The critical initial imperfection mode are (P5) was taken for this aspect ratio. Figures (3.33-3.35) show the same comparison for stiffened plates with aspect ratios ý=1.0,1.5 and 2.0 respectively. The stiffener size examined was again Ds =90-Omm and Ts= 9.Omm. As mentioned in the previous section, the initial imperfection mode (P3) is critical for From the four these aspect ratios and was adopted in this study. graphs, two main conclusions can be drawn. For each aspect ratio, the maximum lateral displacement of the increases with increase in plate slenderness at all stiffener levels of shear stress. The ultimate shear capacity of the stiffened plates of a particular aspect ratio decreases with increase of plate slenderness. This is of course expected and results from the fact that the amplitude The of the web buckles increases with plate slenderness. deflecting panels apply forces to the stiffener which will obviously affect its deflection and hence the capacity of the stiffened plate.

Figure 3.36 shows the stiffener deflections for a panel slenderness of 2.0. The stiffener dimensions are D. = 60 with 0=0.5,1.0,1.5 and 90mm and Ts = 9.Omm. The graph shows a difference in behaviour for 0 values of 1.0,1.5 and 2.0 compared with that for 0=0.5. the For the assumed stiffener dimensions for the case of 0=0.5, is not acting as a rigid boundary for the two web panels as stiffener in figure 3.40. For this case, the stiffener is not having a shown effect on the buckling of the overall stiffened panel and controlling the initial panel buckling stiffness is much lower. Therefore, for 0= 0.5, the maximum lateral displacement in the stiffener is large because it represents the maximum lateral displacement of the It is interesting that in spite of this, the ultimate stiffened plate. this stiffened plate is still the highest, and the relatively capacity of flexible stiffener must still be contributing significantly to this. For the other plate slenderness X= 120,180 and 240, the graphs show a variation with aspect ratio as shown in figures (3.37more consistent For every plate slenderness, the lateral displacement of the 3.39). increases with increase of aspect ratio. stiffener It can generally be concluded that the ultimate shear capacity of the the range considered decreases with increase stiffened plates within for plates of equivalent panel slenderness. of aspect ratio

Figure 3.41 shows the relation between the non-dimensional stress 'C' the non-dimensional shear strain -y' for a plate of aspect ratio 0= and 180 for plates having yield stresses cyy = 1.0 and plate slenderness 240,275 and 355 N/mm 2X= The graphs show an excellent correlation demonstrating the previous conclusion that for a given value of -, -aa unique average stress - strain curve is produced for V-2 tW 355 different yield stresses. There was a need, however, to investigate the same would be true for a flexibly supported panel and whether in particular how the lateral loading applied to the stiffener and its deflection and resulting bending stress varies with consequently the panel yield stress. In order to obtain the lateral force system applied by the panels to the stiffener, a simplified analytical model has been adopted in which the stiffener has been replaced by a non-deflecting nodal line. Clearly stiffener flexibility may well affect the distribution of force the actual stiffener but this effect would not be expected to be on large if the stiffener rigidity is sufficient to restrict stiffener deflection, as will be seen later in chapter five. With this model the applied shear stress of the maximum lateral force (not variation with necessarily at the mid-span of the stiffener) has been examined for the three yield stress values mentioned above, and results for a plate and 2.0 are slenderness of 180 and aspect ratios of 0.5,1.0,1.5 in figures (3-42-3.45). In all the figures it can be seen that shown the magnitude of the force increases with increasing yield stress for a given value of panel shear stress (relative to shear yield), and it can be shown that non-dimensionalising the force relative to the square root of yield stress does not produce a unique result. Figures (3.46-3.47) show the effect of variation of yield stress on the lateral displacement of the stiffener V and the extreme maximum fibre tensile stress at the stiffener outstand cy, for the plate of aspect It can also be deduced that at any stress level, the ratio 0=1.0. stiffener maximum lateral displacement and outstand stress increase with yield stress for plates of the same 0 and X values. This follows b[

from the preceding paragraph due to the increase in the naturally stiffener loading. Clearly if the stiffener loading and resulting Stress and deflection the value of the yield stress then the optimum design size vary with be a function of the yield stress. While the differences are will also it is, however, important to identify the yield stress not major function that controls the stiffener behaviour and design and this is It will be seen that it is possible to discussed in chapter five. the non-dimensional parameter for this effect, as was evaluate done for panel buckling, so that an appropriate design previously can be formulated. equation 3.3.7 Effect

of

stiffener

size parameter

Intermediate transverse stiffeners in web plates loaded in shear have to fulfil two main functions. The first of these is to increase the buckling resistance of the unstiffened web plates. The second is to continue to remain effective until the ultimate capacity of the plate is reached. In order to have an economic and safe stiffened stiffener size, two main points should therefore be looked at. The variation of the maximum out-of-plane displacement of the with its size. stiffener 2The effects of the stiffener parameter y., on the ultimate shear capacity of the stiffened plates.

Figures (3.48-3.51) show the effect of varying stiffener rigidity on the shear capacity of plates of slenderness 60,120,180 and 240 All analyses were performed using critical imperfection respectively. modes identified in section 3.3.3. The general pattern of behaviour was the same for all ý and X. Initially the shear capacity increased significantly with increase in ys. Above a certain value of 7, there was very little further increase in There was however, a difference in the degree to which capacity. this behaviour was evident. As can be seen for the stockier plate, the in strength with stiffener rigidity is really rather slight and variation this clearly reflects the low tendency of this panel to buckle and the small effect the stiffeners have on behaviour. For the more slender panels there is a much clearer definition of the size of stiffener that is needed to enable the limiting peak shear strength to be reached. It should be noted that the shear capacities, as the stiffener rigidity tends to zero, could not be expected to be correct because the single

This increase is also significant for slender webs but small for stocky panels. In order to illustrate the function of the transverse stiffeners, it is of interest to examine the lateral displacement contours and also the effect of the stiffener size on the resulting stiffener displacement. Figures (3.60-3.62) show the lateral displacement contours drawn at 1.0 and X= 60 the plate ultimate shear capacity for the case of and initial imperfection mode (P3).

The stiffener size parameters selected had y. = 19.13,60.50,96.90,147.47 magnitudes and 258.31. The value y. 147.47 corresponds to the value of the rigidity determined from = Figures (3.67-3.69) the design approach presented in chapter 5. 180.

It can be seen that for ys values less than the values determined from the design philosophy, the stiffener is not forming an approximately boundary. Moreover, it is not having a controlling influence on rigid the buckling mode of the overall stiffened plate. 3.3.8 Summary

of

the

range

of

parameters

It was felt to be useful to summarize in a concise tabular form the major findings of the parametric study. Tables (3.2-3.5) have been presented at the end of this chapter. Each table corresponds to a In particular aspect ratio of 0=0.5,1.0,1.5 and 2.0 respectively. every table a brief quantitative description of the varying plate In addition, the maximum shear capacity and geometries is given.

71 the corresponding maximum lateral displacement of the transverse stiffener are tabulated for every case. These results confirm, the conclusions drawn in the previous sections. 3.4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The emphasis of this chapter is to observe the effect of the various geometrical parameters including the rigidity of the stiffeners on the behaviour and peak capacity of a transversely stiffened web loaded in shear. The parameters examined, in addition to stiffener rigidity, form, are the panel slenderness, panel aspect ratio, imperfection stress and the degree of boundary restraint. yield It has been concluded that the unrestrained boundary condition is critical as far as the behaviour of the stiffener is concerned and most that the important panel influence on the stiffener is lateral loading induced by panel buckling. For panels bounded by actual flange there is evidence of a significant tension field loading on members the stiffener but the effect of this, even for the more slender plates considered, is less than the beneficial effect resulting from lateral This indicates stiffener bending restraint provided by the flange. that bending rigidity rather that axial stiffness is the most important parameter for the design of the stiffener and this supports the
emphasis placed on stiffener rigidity

Confirmation of this is considered in greater depth in chapter 5 dealing more directly with stiffener design. The effect of panel slenderness is very much as would be expected, while the effect of aspect ratio shows the importance of selecting the It has been shown that a critical imperfection mode. appropriate different mode is appropriate for the ý=0.5 case compared with the The results also show that the shear other aspect ratios examined. capacity of stiffened plates decreases with increase in aspect ratio. One major conclusion of this parametric study is that the stiffener deflection increases with increasing yield stress and from this it can be inferred that the design requirement for the stiffener is a function of the yield stress of the material, but not that commonly accepted in panel design. As would be expected, the results show that the collapse strength of the stiffened plate is a function of the stiffener rigidity but the effect is very limited for stocky panels reflecting the restricted nature of their buckling prior to the attainment of panel peak load.
