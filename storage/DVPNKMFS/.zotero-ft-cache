Abstract Geometric nonlinear static analysis of shallow and deep sti!ened shells has been conducted on the basis of a combination of Allman's plane stress triangle and Discrete Kirchho! triangle (DKT) plate bending element. The compatibility condition at the shell beam junction is ensured as the same displacement function used for both the shell and the sti!ener element. The formulation of the sti!ener is done in such a manner that it can be placed anywhere within the shell element. The large de#ection equations are based on von Karman's theory. An iterative solution procedure, either Newton}Raphson method or modi"ed Riks method, is employed to trace the nonlinear equilibrium path. The nonlinear static analysis of deep sti!ened shell has been done for the "rst time. A variety of numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the versatility and e$ciency of the present sti!ened shell element. 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Thin plates and shells are extensively used in various engineering structures. They are often sti!ened in various ways to achieve greater strength with relatively less amount of material which satis"es the objective of the minimum weight of the structure and frequently the appearance is enhanced as a bonus. A few examples of sti!ened plate/shell structures are steel chimneys, pipes and conduits, bridges, road tankers, missile bodies, side shell of ships, its deck and superstructures, submarines, o!shore structures and launching pedestal of rockets. Though some literature is available on the large de#ection analysis of sti!ened plates, very little is available on that of sti!ened shells. Surprisingly, the analysis of deep sti!ened shells in large de#ection range has been totally ignored.

Geometric nonlinear static analysis of isotropic and composite sti!ened shells has been done by Liao and Reddy [1] using a continuum-based sti!ened composite shell element. The element is developed from a three-dimensional continuum element based on an incremental, total Lagrangian formulation. Liao and Reddy [2] have also developed a degenerated shell element with a degenerated curved beam element as a sti!ener for geometric nonlinear static analysis of isotropic and composite sti!ened shells. The limitation of the formulation is that the sti!ener must pass through the mesh line of the shell or lie along an element boundary. The mesh division is greatly constrained by the sti!ener position which may create computational di$culties as well. Goswami [3] has analysed geometric nonlinear static analysis of sti!ened shell using nine noded isoparametric sti!ened shell element. The analysis is restricted to shallow shell only. The present study has been undertaken to develop a sti!ened shell element for the geometric nonlinear static analysis of shallow and deep shells. The basic #at shell element has been formulated by combining discrete Kirchho! triangle (DKT) plate bending element [4] and Allman's plane stress triangle [5]. Though combining membrane and bending elements to formulate a #at facetted shell element has been already reported, [6,7] but the marriage of the DKT element and Allman's triangle is done by the authors for the "rst time [8]. The above-mentioned bending and membrane elements have been chosen for the combination purpose as both the elements are triangular in shape and the order of primary displacement functions used to formulate the respective elements are the same (i.e. quadratic for and in bending and u and v for V W membrane). The combined shell element contains six principal degrees of freedom per node, which are u, v, w, , and at three corner points of the element. V W X The main emphasis of the present paper lies in the formulation of the sti!ener element. The arbitrary orientation of the sti!ener has been taken into account to generate the sti!ness matrix of the sti!ener element in the linear and nonlinear range. According to the formulation the sti!ener may lie within the shell element and the mesh line need not pass through the sti!ener. The versatility of this sti!ened shell element has been tested for various shell structures in geometric nonlinear range of static analysis. Several basic shell elements exist for the analysis of shell structures in the linear and nonlinear range. The present shell element has been chosen mainly for the following reasons: (a) The element being facetted, any type of shell surface (shell may be shallow or deep) can be generated easily. (b) The curved shell boundary can conveniently be taken care of as the element is triangular. (c) As the degrees of freedom per node are less (only u, v, w, , and ), the solution is cost e!ective. V W X 2. Mathematical formulation The mathematical formulation is based on the virtual work equation for a continuum within a total Lagrangian coordinate system with the assumption of small strains. The present nonlinear static analysis is carried out using von Karman's large de#ection plate theory. For a continuum, undergoing small or large displacements, the equation of equilibrium of the external and the internal forces is expressed by the following virtual work equations [9,10]: + ,"

Fig. 1b shows the basic element for Allman's plane stress triangular element. Starting point in the formulation of the membrane element is also a 6-noded triangle (Fig. 2b) having 12 degrees of freedom which are reduced to nine degrees of freedom by using constraint conditions. The degrees of freedom "nally are u, v, w, , and at three corners points of the element.

3. Load vector calculation The element load vector has been calculated on the basis of lumped model. To obtain the total load within an element, the area of the element has been multiplied by the intensity of the loading. It is then divided equally in the w direction of the three corner nodes. The global load vector has been formulated by assembly the elemental load, as has been done in the case of sti!ness matrix.

4. Solution procedures The incremental procedure, the step-wise procedure, the iteration procedure and the Newton's method [9] are the generally used solution procedures for the solution of nonlinear equations. Among the available solution procedures, Newton}Raphson method is the commonly used technique to solve a nonlinear equilibrium equation for large de#ection problem, but it cannot handle snap-through phenomenon. The snap-through phenomenon can be de"ned as, instability occurring in certain structures at a particular loading, resulting in the increase of de#ection with the decrease of loading. But after some time the structure regains stability and the de#ection increases with the increase of loading (Fig. 5). To trace this type of complicated load}de#ection path some special technique is required for the solution of the equations. Cris"eld [13] has developed the arc-length procedure which can handle snap-through phenomenon. This arc-length procedure is the modi"ed form of Rik's [14] method. In the present paper both Newton}Raphson method and arc-length procedure have been used to solve the nonlinear static equilibrium equation as per the requirement of the structure.

5. Numerical example 5.1. Clamped rectangular plate with a single stiwener A rectangular plate sti!ened by a central eccentric sti!ener along the shorter direction of the plate has been analysed by the proposed method using a mesh division of 16;8 for the quarter plate. The geometric and material properties of the plate and the sti!ener are shown in Fig. 6. The material properties of the sti!ener have been taken as that of the plate. The plate is subjected to an uniformly distributed vertical load over the entire area of the plate. Koko and Olson [15] have solved this problem using a superelement model and also by the semi-analytical "nite strip method. Sheikh [16] has also solved the problem by using spline "nite strip method. The same problem has been solved by the authors using the general purpose "nite element software NISA using a 16;16 mesh division of a quarter plate. The plate and the sti!ener have been modelled by a three noded triangular numerically integrated element (NKTP 40) and a beam element (NKTP 39) respectively. The de#ections at the plate centre (A) and panel centre (B) obtained in the present analysis are presented in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively, along with those of Koko and Olson [15], Sheikh [16] and NISA. The normal stresses in the X-direction of the plate at the extreme top "bre at the plate centre (A) and at the extreme bottom "bre at the panel centre (B) are compared with Sheikh [16] and NISA in Figs. 9 and 10, respectively. These stresses are the combination of the e!ect of the membrane force and the bending moment. The stress at the plate centre (A) agrees better with NISA than Sheikh [16], whereas the stress at the panel centre (B) agrees well with both NISA and Sheikh [16]. According to Sheikh [16] the stress at plate centre (A) increasingly di!ers with the increase in load level, though the correlation for this case with NISA is good. Tension has been considered as positive for the sign convention of stresses. As the sti!ener acts as a support at the middle of the plate the curvature of the de#ected shape will be negative at the middle portion. With the negative curvature, some of the large de#ection induced membrane stresses should develop compression. The di!erence in stresses between Sheikh [16] and the V

and geometric properties of the plate and sti!eners are shown in Fig. 11. Only one quarter of the plate has been analysed for di!erent mesh sizes. The linear and nonlinear vertical displacements at the centre point of the plate for a load factor 200 are given in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The convergence for the nonlinear analysis shown in Figs. 12a and b is good. This problem is also solved by using irregular mesh divisions (Fig. 11d) to illustrate the e!ectiveness of the present sti!ener element formulation when it is placed within the element and not necessarily along the mesh line. The same problem has also been analysed by general purpose "nite element software NISA with 8;8 mesh division for the quarter plate. A linear triangular 3 noded shell element (NKTP 40) with

6 degrees of freedom per node (u, v, w, , and ) and a 2-D beam element (NKTP 39) have been V W X used for this purpose to model the plate and the sti!ener respectively. The comparison between the present result with NISA as presented in Tables 1 and 2 is good, though the di!erence is more for the case of eccentric sti!ened plate. 5.3. Simply supported spherical shell with symmetric stiweners The geometric nonlinear response of a simply supported sti!ened spherical shell has been investigated by the proposed approach using a 8;8 mesh division in quarter shell (Fig. 13). The material and geometric properties are given by the elastic modulus E"68.97;10⬚ N/m⬚, Poisson's ratio, "0.3, shell thickness, h"0.09945 m, shell radius, R"2.54 m and a"0.7849 m. This problem was previously solved by Liao and Reddy [2]. The unsti!ened shell response has also been solved by Bathe and Ho [6]. The nondimensional de#ection (w/h) at the centre of the shell subjected to a centre point load has been shown in Fig. 14. Both sti!ened and unsti!ened shell have been investigated and the results by the present method have been shown along with the existing results. The sti!ened shell buckled under a centre point load. The e!ect of sti!eners on the response of the shell can be seen from Fig. 14. A good agreement has been found for both the sti!ened and the unsti!ened shells with existing results. This is a typical example of snap-through phenomenon. The arc-length procedure has been adopted to solve the problem as it is not possible to draw the complete nonlinear path by using conventional Newton}Raphson method. 5.4. Pinched stiwened cylinder with rigid diaphragm To test the nonlinear analysis of deep shell, a pinched sti!ened cylindrical shell with rigid diaphragm has been considered. The geometric and material properties and boundary conditions are shown in Fig. 15.

The linear analysis of this unsti!ened shell is a common test for various shell elements (e.g. [6,7,17]). The nonlinear solution of this unsti!ened shell has also been available in [18,19]. But to the best of authors' knowledge, the nonlinear response of this shell as a sti!ened form is being presented for the "rst time. To generate the actual curved surface in an approximate manner, a "ne mesh division is required. Here an octant shell (due to symmetry) has been discritized by 40;16 mesh division (40 along the circumference and 16 along the axis). The curve for downward de#ection under the load, versus normalized load has been shown in Fig. 16 for both the unsti!ened and the sti!ened shells.

The present unsti!ened shell results have been compared with that of Saleeb et al. [18] and the solution available in NISA manual [19]. The same sti!ened shell has been solved by the author using the general purpose software NISA using a 24;12 mesh division in octant shell (same mesh division used for unsti!ened shell in NISA manual, [19]). A three noded triangular shell element with 6 d.o.f (u, v, w, , and ) (NKTP 40) and a 3-D beam element have been chosen for the V W X purpose of modelling the shell and sti!ener, respectively. Here the maximum load factor (P/P ) is ⬚ taken as 3, where P "812.536 N (182.6lb) is the load 'typically' utilised for linear unsti!ened shell ⬚ solution (e.g. [20]). The downward nonlinear de#ections of sti!ened shell under the load for a load factor, (P/P )"3 are 0.0625 and 0.0676 m for the present and the NISA solution, respectively, ⬚ whereas for this load the linear static de#ections are 0.0381 and 0.0394 m for the present and the NISA solution, respectively.

6. Conclusions A new sti!ened shell element has been developed for the geometric nonlinear static analysis of sti!ened shell structures. The basic shell element contains drilling degrees of freedom which plays a signi"cant role for the imposing of boundary conditions in shell structures. The fact that the sti!ener can be placed anywhere within the shell element obviates the restriction of mesh grading and, has enabled the treatment of sti!ened shell problems in a more elegant manner. Numerical examples have been presented to show the e!ectiveness of the arbitrarily oriented sti!ener formulation. In addition to shallow shell examples, a deep sti!ened shell problem has been solved for the "rst time. Present results when compared with the existing ones as well as those obtained from the general purpose software have yielded good correlation. The element has been found to behave satisfactorily for plates as well as shell structures. However, an improved accuracy can be achieved by taking proper account of the curvature of a shell in the "nite element design.
