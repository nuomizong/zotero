In this paper, ﬁnite element method has been applied to analyze free vibration problems of laminated composite stiffened shallow spherical shell panels with cutouts employing the eight-noded curved quadratic isoparametric element for shell with a three noded beam element for stiffener formulation. Speciﬁc numerical problems of earlier investigators are solved and compared to validate the present formulation. Moreover, free vibration problem of stiffened shallow spherical shell panels with different size and position of the cutouts with respect to the shell centre for different edge constraints are examined to arrive at some conclusions useful to the designers. The results are presented in the form of ﬁgures and tables. The results are further analyzed to suggest guidelines to select optimum size and position of the cutout with respect to shell centre considering different practical constraints.

1. Introduction Finite element method has become an efﬁcient tool to analyze complex structures and materials. The dynamic analysis of shell structures, which may have complex geometry and arbitrary loading and boundary conditions, can be solved efﬁciently by the ﬁnite element method, even including cutouts in shells. Laminated composites are increasingly being used nowadays in aerospace, civil, marine and other related weight-sensitive engineering applications requiring high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to weight ratios. Some of the structural components of aircrafts, missile and ship structures can be idealized as composite shell panels. The most commonly encountered types of shell structures are shells of revolution. Amongst all the existing shells of different geometry, spherical shells, shells of revolution with curved meridian, have many applications in all types of industries. Spherical pressure vessels are a common phenomenon in the chemical and process industries. Quite often, to save weight and also to provide a facility for inspection, cutouts are provided in these panels. In practice the margin of the cutouts must be stiffened to take account of stress concentration effects. Also, there can be some instruments directly ﬁxed on these panels, and the safety of these instruments

can be dependent on the vibration characteristics of the panels. Hence free vibration studies on laminated composite spherical shell panels with cutouts are of interest to both structural engineers and materials scientists. Different computational models for laminated composites were proposed by Kapania [1], Noor and Burton [2], and Reddy [3]. Chao and Reddy [4] reported on the dynamic response of simply supported cylindrical and spherical shells. The transient response of spherical and cylindrical shells with various boundary conditions and loading was reported by Reddy and Chandrashekhara [5]. Chao and Tung [6] presented an investigation on the dynamic response of axisymmetric polar orthotropic hemispherical shells. Later free vibration study of doubly curved shells was done by Qatu [7], Liew and Lim [8-9], Chakravorty et al. [10e12], Shin [13] and Tan [14]. Kant et al. [15] solved problems of a clamped spherical and simply supported cylindrical cap under external pressure. Sathyamoorthy [16] reported the nonlinear vibration of moderately thick orthotropic spherical shells. Later in 1997, Gautham and Ganesan [17] reported free vibration characteristics of isotropic and laminated orthotropic spherical caps while Chia and Chia [18] reported nonlinear vibration of moderately thick antisymmetric angle ply shallow spherical shell. Free vibration of curved panels with cutouts was reported by Sivasubramonian et al. [19]. Qatu et al. [20] reviewed the work done on the vibration aspects of composite shells between 2000 and 2009 and observed that most of the researchers dealt with closed cylindrical shells.

Other shell geometries have also been investigated. Among those conical shells and shallow shells on rectangular, triangular, trapezoidal, circular, elliptical, rhombic or other planforms are receiving considerable attention. Shallow spherical shells also received some attention. Wang et al. [21] studied wave propagation of stresses in orthotropic thick-walled spherical shells. Lellep and Hein [22] did an optimization study on shallow spherical shells under impact loading. Dai and Wang [23] analyzed stress wave propagation in laminated piezoelectric spherical shells under thermal shock and electric excitation. Dynamic stability of spherical shells was studied by Ganapathi [24] and Park and Lee [25]. Recently, Kumar et al. [26-29] considered ﬁnite element formulation for shell analysis based on higher order zigzag theory. Vibration analysis of spherical shells and panels both shallow and deep has also been reported for different boundary conditions [30e33]. A complete and general view on mathematical modeling of laminated composite shells using higher order formulations has been provided in recent literature [34e36]. However shallow spherical shell panels on rectangular or circular planform (spherical cap) with cutout (stiffened along the margin) are missing in the existing literature. Accordingly, the present endeavor focuses on the free vibration behavior of composite shallow spherical shell with cutout (stiffened along the margin) with concentric and eccentric cutouts, and considers the shells to have various boundary conditions.

2. Mathematical formulation A laminated composite spherical shell of uniform thickness h (Fig. 1) and radius of curvature Rxx and Ryy is considered. Keeping the total thickness the same, the thickness may consist of any number of thin laminae each of which may be arbitrarily oriented at an angle q with reference to the x-axis of the co-ordinate system. The constitutive equations for the shell are given by (Deﬁnitions of symbols used are given in list of notations):

The element mass matrices are assembled to get the global matrices. 3.3. Modeling the cutout The code developed can take the position and size of cutout as input. The program is capable of generating non uniform ﬁnite element mesh all over the shell surface. So the element size is gradually decreased near the cutout margins. One such typical mesh arrangement is shown in Fig. 3 where the mesh divisions are in the ratio 6:4:4:3:3:3:3:4:4:6. Such ﬁnite element mesh is redeﬁned in steps and a particular grid is chosen to obtain the fundamental frequency when the result does not improve by more than one percent on further reﬁning. Convergence of results is ensured in all the problems taken up here. 3.4. Solution procedure for free vibration analysis

Here, [N] is a 3 Â 3 diagonal matrix for stiffener.

This is a generalized eigen value problem and is solved by the subspace iteration algorithm. The present formulation does not use penalty method. A general formulation is attempted using eight noded curved quadratic isoparametric ﬁnite elements with all three radii of curvature. Each of the nodes has ﬁve degrees of freedom: two in-plane displacement, one transverse displacement and two rotations. Each of these parameters is approximated by quadratic polynomials having eight terms. The general dynamic problem is derived from Lagrange's equation using Hamilton's principles. Subspace iteration is employed to solve the free vibration problem. The generalized formulation considers all three radii of curvature viz. Rxx, Ryy and Rxy. The shell surface considered for the present study is spherical which has the following features and can be handled by the proposed formulation as a special case: Doubly curved and synclastic surface having 1/Rxx ¼ 1/Ryy, both positive and 1/Rxy ¼ 0.

derived from a cubic interpolation polynomial. It is an established fact that a polynomial of degree (2nÀ1) is integrated exactly by n point Gauss quadrature. 4. Validation study The results of Table 1 show that the agreement of present results with the earlier ones is close and the correctness of the stiffener formulation is established. The present results differ from previous published literature [41] which follows Mindlin's hypothesis. Moreover, the formulation therein considers shear deformation; hence it is applicable for both thick and thin plates. The present formulation uses modiﬁed Sander's ﬁrst approximation theory for thin shells. Here for comparison, a shell has been converted to a plate considering a high value of radius of curvature. This may be the reason for the present results differing from the previous published literature. Free vibration of corner point supported, simply supported and clamped spherical shells of (0/90)4 lamination with cutouts is also considered. The fundamental frequencies of spherical shell with cutout obtained by the present method agree well with those reported by Chakravorty et al. [12] as evident from Table 2, establishing the correctness of the cutout formulation. Thus it is evident that the ﬁnite element model proposed here can successfully analyze vibration problems of stiffened composite spherical shells with cutout which is reﬂected by close agreement of present results with benchmark ones. The results in Table 3 show that the

convergence of the results is monotonic. Finer mesh beyond 10x10 does not improve the result. Thus 10 Â 10 mesh is chosen in the present study. 5. Results and discussion In order to study the effect of cutout size and position on the free vibration response additional problems for spherical shells with 0/ 90/0/90 and þ45/À45/þ45/À45 lamination and different boundary conditions have been solved. The positions of the cutouts are varied along both of the plan directions of the shell for different practical boundary conditions to study the effect of eccentricity of cutout on the fundamental frequency. 5.1. Free vibration behavior of shells with concentric cutouts Tables 4 and 5 furnish the results of non-dimensional frequency ðuÞ of 0/90/0/90 and þ45/À45/þ45/À45 stiffened spherical shells with cutout respectively. The shells considered are of square plan form (a ¼ b) and the cutouts are also taken to be square in plan (a0 ¼ b0 ). The cutouts placed concentrically on the shell surface. The cutout sizes (i.e. a0 /a) are varied from 0 to 0.4 and boundary conditions are varied along the four edges. Cutouts are concentric on shell surface. The stiffeners are placed along the cutout periphery and extended up to the edge of the shell. The boundary conditions are designated by describing the support clamped or simply supported as C or S taken in an anticlockwise

order from the edge x ¼ 0. This means a shell with CSCS boundary is clamped along x ¼ 0, simply supported along y ¼ 0 and clamped along x ¼ a and simply supported along y ¼ b. For clamped boundary condition, all ﬁve degrees of freedom are restrained. For simply supported boundary condition, three degrees of freedom (v, w and b) are restrained which implies shear force is present at simply supported edge but bending moment is zero. The material and geometric properties of shells and cutouts are mentioned along with the Tables.

angle ply shells with the increase of cutout size loss of stiffness is more than loss of mass. Hence fundamental frequency decreases except in case of CSCS and corner point supported angle ply shells (a0 /a ¼ 0.2e0.3). In such cases, as the cutout grows in size the loss of mass is more signiﬁcant than loss of stiffness, and hence the frequency increases. As with the introduction of a cutout of a0 /a ¼ 0.2, in shell surface, the frequency increases in most of the cases, this leads to the engineering conclusion that concentric cutouts with stiffened margins may be provided safely on shell surfaces for functional requirements upto a0 /a ¼ 0.2.

5.1.1. Effect of cutout size on fundamental frequency From Tables 4 and 5 it is seen that when a cutout is introduced to a stiffened shell the fundamental frequency increases in all the cases. This increasing trend is noticed for both cross ply and angle ply shells. This initial increase in frequency is due to the fact that with the introduction of cutout, numbers of stiffeners are increase from two to four in the present study. It is evident from Tables 4 and 5 that in all the cases with the introduction of cutout with a0 /a ¼ 0.2 the frequencies increase. But further increase in cutout size, fundamental frequency may increase or decrease. When the cutout size is further increased, but the number and dimensions of the stiffeners do not change, the shell surface undergoes loss of both mass and stiffness. It is evident from Tables 4 and 5 that when the cutout size is increased, fundamental frequency is increased in all cases of cross ply shells. For angle ply shells also with the increase of cutout size fundamental frequency increases upto a0 /a ¼ 0.2, but with further increase of cutout size reverse trend is observed. So for

5.1.2. Effect of boundary conditions The boundary conditions may be arranged in the following order, considering number of boundary constraints. CCCC, CSCC, CSSC, CSCS, SSSS and Corner Point supported. Tables 6 and 7 show the efﬁciency of a particular clamping option in improving the fundamental frequency of a shell with minimum number of boundary constraints relative to that of a clamped shell. Marks are assigned to each boundary combination in a scale assigning a value of 0 to the frequency of a corner point supported shell and 100 to that of a fully clamped shell. These marks are furnished for cutouts with a0 /a ¼ 0.2 These tables will enable a practicing engineer to realize at a glance the efﬁciency of a particular boundary condition in improving the frequency of a shell, taking that of clamped shell as the upper limit. It is seen from Tables 6 and 7, that fundamental frequencies of members belonging to same number of boundary constraints may not have close values. So the boundary constraint is

not the sole criteria for its performance. The free vibration characteristics mostly depend on the arrangement of boundary constraints rather than their actual numbers. It can be seen from the present study that if the circular edge along x ¼ a is released from clamped to simply supported, the change of frequency is more in case of an angle ply shells than that for cross ply shells. Again, if the two adjacent edges are released, fundamental frequency decreases than that of a clamped shell. This is true for both cross and angle ply shells. For cross ply shells this decrease in frequency is very much signiﬁcant. Further, if the two alternate edges are released from clamped to simply supported fundamental frequency do not change to a great extent in case of a cross ply shells whereas, change in frequency is about 29% in case of an angle ply shell. For cross ply shells if three or four edges are simply supported, frequency values undergo marked decrease but for angle ply shells with the

introduction of more number of simply supported edges the frequency value does not change so drastically. The results indicate that two alternate edges should preferably be clamped in order to achieve higher frequency values. 5.1.3. Mode shapes The mode shapes corresponding to the fundamental modes of vibration are plotted in Figs. 4 and 5 for cross-ply and angle ply shells respectively. The normalized displacements are drawn with the shell mid-surface as the reference for all the support condition and for all the lamination used here. The fundamental mode is clearly a bending mode for all the boundary condition for cross ply and angle ply shell, except corner point supported shell. For corner point supported shells the fundamental mode shapes are complicated. With the introduction of cutout mode shapes remain almost similar. When the size of the cutout is increased from 0.2 to 0.4 the

fundamental modes of vibration do not change to an appreciable amount. 5.2. Effect of eccentricity of cutout position 5.2.1. Fundamental frequency The effect of eccentricity of cutout positions on fundamental frequencies, are studied from the results obtained for different locations of a cutout with a0 /a ¼ 0.2. The non-dimensional coordinates of the cutout centre ðx ¼ x=a; y ¼ y=aÞ was varied from 0.2 to 0.8 along each directions, so that the distance of a cutout margin from the shell boundary was not less than one tenth of the plan dimension of the shell. The margins of cutouts were stiffened with four stiffeners. The study was carried out for all the seven boundary conditions for both cross ply and angle ply shells. The fundamental frequency of a shell with an eccentric cutout is expressed as a percentage of fundamental frequency of a shell with a concentric cutout. This percentage is denoted by r. In Tables 8 and 9 such results are furnished. It can be seen that eccentricity of the cutout along the length of the shell towards the edges makes it more ﬂexible. It is also seen that almost all the cases r value is

maximum in and around x ¼ 0:5 and y ¼ 0:5. It is noticed that towards the clamped edge r value is greater than that of the simply supported edge when only one edge is simply supported. When two adjacent edges are simply supported no such uniﬁed trend is observed. Moreover, when three edges are simply supported, the simply supported edge opposite to the clamped one shows more frequency value than that of the clamped edge. For corner point supported shells the maximum fundamental frequency always occurs along the diagonal of the shell. Tables 10 and 11 provide the maximum values of r together with the position of the cutout. These tables also show the rectangular zones within which r is always greater than or equal to 90. It is to be noted that at some other points r values may have similar values,

but only the zone rectangular in plan has been identiﬁed. These tables indicate the maximum eccentricity of a cutout which can be permitted if the fundamental frequency of a concentrically punctured shell is not to reduce a drastic amount. So these tables will help practicing engineers. 5.2.2. Mode shapes The mode shapes corresponding to the fundamental modes of vibration are plotted in Figs. 6e9 for cross-ply and angle ply shell of CCCC and CSCC shells for different eccentric position of the cutout. All the mode shapes are bending mode. It is found that for different position of cutout mode shapes are somewhat similar to one another, only the crest and trough position changes.

The laminated composite ﬁnite element shell model proposed in the present study can work also with anisotropic lamination schemes such as 30/45 or 30/60, 30/65/45 etc. However, the present study considers only symmetric and antisymmetric lamination schemes. Future studies will consider anisotropic lamination schemes. 6. Conclusions The following conclusions may be drawn from the present study: 1. As this approach produces results in close agreement with those of the benchmark problems the ﬁnite element code used here is suitable for analyzing free vibration problems of stiffened spherical panels with cutouts. 2. The arrangement of boundary constraints along the four edges is far more important than their actual number so far the free vibration is concerned. 3. If fully clamped shell is released for any functional reason, then opposite edges must be released to avoid excessive loss in frequency. 4. The relative free vibration performances of shells for different combinations of edge conditions along four sides are expected to be very useful in decision-making for practicing engineers. 5. The information regarding the behavior of stiffened spherical shell panel with eccentric cutouts for a wide spectrum of eccentricity and boundary conditions for cross ply and angle ply shells may also be used as design aids for structural engineers. 6. From this study we get the speciﬁc zones within which the cutout centre may be moved so that the loss of frequency is less than 10% with respect to a shell with a central cutout. That will help an engineer to make a decision regarding the eccentricity of the cutout centre that he can allow. References
