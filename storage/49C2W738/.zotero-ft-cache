[Maxwell’s Lemma]
[¶i] Maxwell (1890:175–177) has shown that for all frames under a given system of applied forces {in equilibrium}1 ℓp fp − ℓq fq = C, (1)

where fp is the tension in any tie-bar of length ℓp , fq the thrust in any strut of length ℓq , and the ﬁrst sum is taken for all the ties, the second for all the struts.2 C is shown to be a function of the applied forces and the coordinates of their points of application, and independent of the form of the frame.3 [¶ii] Starting from this result, we can ﬁnd in certain cases lower limits to the quantity of material necessary to sustain given forces {in equilibrium}, and also assign the forms of frames which attain the limit of economy.4

[Volume of Material as a Cost Measure]
[¶iii] If the greatest tensile stress allowable in the material which is to be employed is P, and the greatest compressive stress Q, the least volume of material in a given frame, consistent with security, is5 ℓp fp + P ℓq fq = V. Q (2)

[Michell’s Lemma]
[¶iv] Now, considering a number of diﬀerent frames in equilibrium under the same set of external forces, in that one of the frames in V is least 2PQ · V + (P − Q)C is also least; fq fp + (P − Q) ℓq 2PQ ℓp + P Q = (P + Q) or ℓp fp + ℓq fq is least, (3)

ℓ|f | is least

where |f | denotes the numerical value of the force in any bar, and the sum is taken for both struts and ties.6 [¶v] One proof given by Maxwell of the equation (1) above depends on consideration of the virtual work of the applied forces and internal stresses during an imposed uniform dilatation or contraction of the frame. Consideration of a more general type of imposed deformation will furnish information as to the quantity ℓ|f |.7

[First Michell’s Theorem]
[¶vi] Let the space within a given boundary, which encloses a number of diﬀerent frames subjected in turn to the same of applied forces {in equilibrium}, undergo an arbitrary deformation of which the frames partake and such that no linear element in the spaces suﬀers and extension or contraction numerically greater than ǫ · δℓ, where δℓ is the length of the element and ǫ a given small fraction. [¶vii] In this deformation, let any bar of length ℓ of one of the frames, A, undergo the small change of length eℓ, which is to be taken as positive when it increases the existing strain in the bar due to the applied forces, negative in the contrary case. The increase in the elastic energy8 of the bar is eℓf and for the

whole frame eℓf = δW, [4] by the principle of Virtual Works, where δW is the virtual work of the applied forces, and is independent of the form of the frame A.9 Thus δW = eℓf > |e|ℓ|f | > ǫℓ|f | > ǫ ℓ|f | [5] δW , ǫ indicating by the suﬃxes that the inequality applies to the frame A. ℓA |f |A < or [6]

[Second Michell’s Theorem]
[¶viii] If, however, a frame, M, can be found, such that all its parts have their strains increased equally and by as much as any elementary line in the deformed space i.e. if e = ǫ in all parts the signs of inequality may be replaced by that of equality, and10 δW > ℓA |f |A , [7] ℓM |f |M = ǫ so that ℓM |f |M is a minimum,11 and consequently from (3), Vm , the volume of material in the frame M, is also a minimum.

[Suﬃcient Optimality Criterion]
[¶ix] A frame therefore attains the limit of economy of material possible, in any frame-structure under the same applied forces {in equilibrium12 }, if the space occupied by it can be subjected to appropriate small deformation, such that the strains in all the bars of the frame are increased by equal fractions of their lengths, not less than the fractional change of length of any element of the space. [¶x] If the space subjected to the deformation extends to inﬁnity in all directions, the volume of the frame is a minimum relatively to all others, otherwise it will have been shown to be a minimum only relatively to those within the same assigned ﬁnite boundary.13

[Special Class of Minimum Frame-structures]
[¶xi] The condition e = ǫ can evidently be satisﬁed when all the bars of a frame have stresses of the same sign. The test deformation to be applied is then a uniform dilatation or contraction (according as the frame is in tension

or compression) of a space enclosing the frame and extending to any ﬁnite boundary or to inﬁnity at pleasure. [¶xii] The simplest minimum frames of this special class are: 1. Ties and struts subjected to a single pair of equal and opposed forces. 2. Triangular and tetrahedral frames under forces applied at the angles of the ﬁgure, and acting along lines which intersect within the ﬁgure. 3. Catenaries in general, the points of application of the applied forces, all well as the forces themselves, being given. [¶xiii] In all these cases the minimum volume of the frame is Vm = ℓ|f | δW = = P ǫP ǫFr cos θ = ǫP Fr cos θ , P [8]

where F is one of the applied forces, r the distance of its point of application, R, from an arbitrary ﬁxed point O, θ the angle between RO and the direction of F, and P is the allowable stress in the material.14

[General Class of Minimum Frame-structures]
[¶xiv] A more general class of frames satisfying the condition e = ǫ, consist of those whose bars, both before and after the appropriate deformation, form curves or orthogonal systems. [¶xv] In such a system the test strains may be equal and of the same sign, or equal and opposite, in the directions at right angles, without the strains in the bars being exceeded by those of any other lines in the ﬁeld. In the ﬁrst case the strain is evidently the same in all directions; in the second, if λ, −λ are the strains in the principal directions, the strain in any direction at an angle θ to one of them is ±λ cos 2θ = λ′ , [to one of them is?] |λ′ | > |λ|.

[Diﬀerential Condition for the Test Deformation]
[¶xvi] [Proposition:] The condition that a two-dimensional orthogonal system shall remain orthogonal after equal and opposite extensions of its two series of curves, is that the inclination between any two adjacent curves of the same series is constant throughout their length. This is easily seen as follows. [¶xvii] [Proof:] Let l the elementary length, φ the change of direction of the curve S1 , between its points of intersection with two adjacent curves R1 R2 of the other series, and let m be the elementary length of R1 between the two curves S1 , S2 of the S-series, m being taken small in comparison with l. [¶xviii] Let the curves of the S-series be extended by the small fraction λ of their length.

[¶xix] If the element remains rectangular the change in the angle φ must be equal to the change in the inclination of the elements R1 and R2 to each other15 , dl λl − λ l + dm · m dl = −λ = λφ. [9] δφ = m dm [¶xx] Take now a new element, with sides of comparable length, l, n, formed by the pairs of curves R1 R2 , S1 Sk . Let ψ be the change of direction of R1 between S1 and Sk , and let λ′ be extension of the R curves. [¶xxi] Then, as before, δψ = λ′ ψ; and making a circuit around the element, since the angles remain right angles, λ· dφ dψ n − λ′ · l = 0, dn dl [10]

but dφ · n − dψ · l = 0, because the angles were right angles before the defordn dl mation. Thus, since λ′ = λ, by assumption dφ = 0, dn and dψ = 0. Q.E.D. dl [11]

[Subclasses of Optimum Orthogonal Curves]
[¶xxii] There are two general classes of orthogonal curves satisfying the required conditions [e = ǫ y ([11])], viz.:

1. Systems of tangents and involutes derived from any evolute curves. (Since such systems are bounded by the evolute curves, the corresponding frames are in general of minimum volume only relatively to others with the same ﬁnite boundaries.) 2. Orthogonal systems of equiangular spirals, with systems of concentric circles and their radii, and rectangular networks of straight lines, as special cases. [¶xxiii] Frames whose bars coincide with the curves of any of these systems are therefore frames of minimum quantity of material, for any system of forces consistent with their equilibrium and continuity of displacement.16 [¶xxiv] Frames may also be built up of parts of diﬀerent systems of these classes provided that continuity of displacement is secured along the lines of junction.

[Examples]
[¶xxv] Examples of such frames of minimum quantity of material, for some elementary systems of forces, are given in the accompanying ﬁgures. [¶xxvi] Compression bars in each case are indicated by thick, and tension bars by ﬁne, continuous lines. Those portions of the lines of principal strain on which material bars are not required are shown by dotted lines.

1. [Michell’s Cantilever]
[¶xxvii] (Figure 1.) A single force F applied at A, and acting at right angles to the line AB, is balanced by an equal and opposite force and a couple, of moment F × AB, applied at B. [¶xxviii] The minimum frame is formed of two similar equiangular spirals having their origin at B and intersecting orthogonally at A, together with all the other spirals orthogonal to these and enclosed between them. [¶xxix] All the spirals of one series are equally extended, those of the other system equally compressed to the same degree. The spirals may be extended to inﬁnity, and the inﬁnite ﬁeld will remain continuous with equal and opposite strains in the principal directions at all points. The necessary volume of material is inﬁnite if the frame is continued to a mere point at B; but if forces equivalent to the force F, and the couple F × AB at B, are distributed over a small circle with its centre at B, and the radius r0 , the volume necessary is Fa · log a · r0 1 1 + P Q , ([12])

where a = AB, and P, Q are the stresses allowed for tension and compression.17

[¶xxx] (Figure 2.) A single force, F, is applied at C, the middle point of the line AB, and is balanced by equal parallel forces at A and B. [¶xxxi] The minimum frame is composed of the two quadrantal bars DF and EG, having their common centre at C, of all the radii of these quadrants, and their four tangents AD, AE, BF and BG. The orthogonal system is completed and extended to inﬁnity as indicated by the dotted lines. [¶xxxii] The quadrants above C and all straight lines extending obliquely downwards and outwards from the line of action of F are compressed, all the other lines extended.

[¶xxxv] The form of the minimum frame is then as in Figure 3, and consists of the semicircle on AB and its radii. The ﬁgure to be subjected to the test deformation consists of the semi-inﬁnite plane below AB, all the radii from C being extended and the semicircles about C compressed.

3. [[Three Forces: Symmetric Pair and That Other that Equilibrates Them?]]
[¶xxxvii] (Figure 4) Constructions similar to that of Figures 2 & 3 give the minimum frames for three forces, two of which are equal and directed to a point on the line of action of the third outside the triangle formed by the points of application of the forces. Figure 4 is an example. [¶xxxviii] The sectors DCG′ , FCE′ , undergo uniform bulk compression, the remainder of the ﬁeld pure shear as in Figure 2.

[¶xlii] All the rhumb-lines of one series and all similar lines on spheres concentric with the spherical frame are uniformly and equally extended, all the lines orthogonal to these on the spheres equally compressed.
