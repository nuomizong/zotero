Abstract This paper presents a new robotic additive manufacturing (AM) framework for fabricating 2.5D surface designs to add material explicitly along principal stress trajectories. AM technologies, such as fused deposition modelling (FDM), are typically based on processes that lead to anisotropic products with strength behaviour that varies according to ﬁlament orientation; this limits their application in both design prototypes and end-use parts and products. Since stress lines are curves that indicate the optimal paths of material continuity for a given design boundary, the proposed stress-line based oriented material deposition opens new possibilities for structurally-performative and geometrically-complex AM, which is supported here by fabrication and structural load testing results. Called stress line additive manufacturing (SLAM), the proposed method achieves an integrated workﬂow that synthesizes parametric design, structural optimization, robotic computation, and fabrication.

CNC-based paradigm (Schwartz 2013), in which machine operation is isolated from design. With a limited interface between conception and materialization, designers have few opportunities to affect the qualities that the fabrication embeds in the ﬁnal artefacts. This paper presents a new robotic-enabled FDM technique that is structure-based and material-centric, to enable the systematic reproduction of high-quality, and performance based printed structures for a given 2.5D (surface) design boundary using common software interfaces and electronic components. Called “Stress Line Additive Manufacturing (SLAM), the proposed method is contextualized within a broader conceptual structural design methodology; the integrated software-hardware framework addresses FDM–today’s most common AM method (Gibson et al. 2010)—and seeks to facilitate ﬂexible design-space exploration and fabrication standardization. From standardized 3D printing platforms, such as the hobbyist and professional options developed by MakerBot Industries and Stratasys, to full scale AM systems like D-Shape1 and Contour Crafting,2 layer-based conventions reduce aesthetic quality, material efﬁciency, and geometrical accuracy. Particularly problematic for FDM-based techniques, layer-based conventions produce anisotropic material behaviour with strength and ductility properties that vary signiﬁcantly depending on the ﬁlament orientation: the tensile capacity of specimens loaded perpendicular to ﬁlament orientation can be up to 50 % weaker than specimens loaded in parallel, because the weak fusion between horizontal layers provides a natural weak point for breakage (Mueller et al. 2014). These problems limit both the durability of the printed specimen, and the end-use application of AM. This paper focuses on FDM’s most fundamental mechanism: robotic ﬂexibility is used to directly achieve ﬁlament depositions that conform to desired material behaviour—printed along trajectories revealed computationally to enhance assembly strength. Recognizing the directionally dependent performance characteristics of FDM processes, ﬁlaments are aligned to major axial networks of curvatures called principal stress lines.

2 Stress Lines: Theory, Suitability and Additive Manufacturing
The emergence of structural analysis tools within common design platforms, such as Karamba 3D3 and other similar plug-ins, has created an environment favourable to stress-line-inspired fabrication, yet often structural patterns are employed without being substantiated by structural logic. Precedents combining robotic fabrication with stress lines include the ICD’s Leichtbau BW Installation,4 and the GSD’s Robotic Beat Rolling (Friedman et al. 2014). In contrast, this paper focuses on the production of stress-line-based surfaces with enhanced structural performance.

Fig. 1 Stress line properties and suitability in design and additive manufacturing

Stress lines are numeric integrations of principal stress directions over each inﬁnitesimal element that comprises an investigated structural body. Designers are interested in principal stress lines because they provide a visualization of the natural force ﬂow in a structure, which shows the lines of desirable material continuity for a given design domain (Michalatos and Kaijima 2014). This characteristic is evidenced by the typical convergence of results obtained from analytical and numerical optimization procedures and from the principal stress lines generated for the same design boundary (Fig. 1.1). Theoretical properties of stress lines support their application in FDM: Firstly, conventional numerical optimization methods, such as ground structure and homogenization methods, tend to produce complex results that are computationally exhaustive to manipulate (Brackett et al. 2011), and difﬁcult to summarize as line-based paths. Stress lines offer computational ease for fabrication and optimization information (Fig. 1.1). Secondly, design abstraction is enabled as stress line methods are highly suitable for geometric exploration (Fig. 1.2), so that results can reﬂect design boundaries, regardless of the scaling of material properties, applied force, or the objects’ dimensions (Li and Chen 2010). Thirdly, geometric compatibility is signiﬁcant (Fig. 1.3). Since stress distribution for elastic continuum bodies are also continuous, stress lines create contour-like ﬁelds with curvatures that typically traverse from one design boundary to another: these properties lend to their consistently-clean robotic deposition and efﬁcient linkages as printing paths. Thus, a framework becomes available from stress line computation to load testing to robotic fabrication (Fig. 2).

3 Methodology
To capitalize on the critical relationship between architectural geometry and structural behaviour in order to generate innovation in each, the project combines structural design space exploration, topology optimization, and robotic fabrication, and introduces a physical testing protocol in order to deliver structurally informed

geometric feedback. It builds on previous research into stress lines where computation is broken down into initialization, generation, and processing (Tam and Mueller 2015). The design scope is here a 4-support grid shell with application for design space exploration with 2.5D membrane structures. The fabrication environment contains a custom extrusion module that is mounted to a KUKA KR6 R900 small robot that is located centrally inside a contained envelope (Fig. 3). For the prototyping, the project used 3D modelling software McNeel Rhinoceros and the scripting plugin Grasshopper, with structural analysis conducted using the plug-in Karamba on a surface design form-found using Kangaroo Physics. Robot programming followed a precise set of criteria for the KRL code, with robot instructions generated in RobotMaster,5 a plugin to MasterCAM.6 The print surface (milled from a laminated MDF block) is positioned at an eccentricity from the robot to minimize joint issues. PLA plastic is used as ﬁlament material, for its adhesion capacity to MDF and printability on an unheated surface without warping. Adapted to SLAM, a multi-objective processing method was developed to balance aesthetic, fabrication, and performance objectives. Essentially, the optimization procedure assembles a new 3D-frame structure in each iteration with stress lines that are heuristically selected by a genetic algorithm. A FEA is conducted to determine the strain energy, normalized by material volume, of the new frame structure with each iteration; the combination of stress lines minimizing total strain energy is selected for materialization (Fig. 4). Speciﬁcally, each stress line within the base ﬁeld is assigned a binary value that determines its inclusion or exclusion in or from the assembled frame structure for each iteration. The list of binary values for each of the two principal planes is in turn generated according to a ratio of on- to off-values—a ratio that acts as proxy for stress line spacing corresponding to various global stress line densities. Thus, an inﬁnite design space is characterized only by two design variables in the procedure.

With the density of the stress lines optimally calibrated, a series of rules-based corrections are iteratively applied to the resulting stress line topology in order to achieve additional improvements in the results (Fig. 5). A rule-base system can codify and implement existing rules, and can expand to accommodate additional rules as the experimentations continue to develop new knowledge. Rules that were designed speciﬁcally for the SLAM framework to improve ﬁlament extrusion ease include the removal of line segments in areas with signiﬁcant stress line overlap, and the realignment of otherwise converging stress lines in highly-stressed areas. General structural rules include modiﬁcation of stress line curvatures to facilitate force transfers at intersection nodes, and the insertion of bracing members. Although the initial implementation of the rule-based system was largely dependent on manual operations, the process is to be automated in future developments.

4 Robotic Tool and Workﬂow Design 4.1 End Effector Design

Referencing current extrusion devices in consumer-grade applications, the custom extruder is composed of a waterjet-cut aluminium frame that is mechanically coupled to the robot via a pneumatic tool changer (Fig. 6.1). The aluminium frame holds a commercially available extruder and control electronics. The Signstek extruder accepts 1.75 mm PLA (polyactic acid) plastic and is composed of a 1.8 degree stepper motor, heating element, thermistor, and cooling fan (Fig. 6.2). Using an Arduino Uno microcontroller and a N-Type MOSEF, the closed loop temperature control (PWM) of the extruder nozzle was utilized. The KUKA’s 24 V signal outputs were monitored by the on-board Arduino and were used to start and stop the stepper motor/extrusion. Control of the stepper motor was achieved with an EasyDriver board that uses an Allegro A3967 motor driver chip.

4.2

Robotic Programming Interface and Parameters

The typical workﬂow consists of the following iterative and trial-and-error procedure: (1) Import of print surface and stress line data from CAD into CAM software; (2) Specimen positioning in the workspace; (3) Print surface calibration in the CAM model space; (4) Clustering of paths based on robot work volume and reach limitations; (5) Assigning stress-line-based geometry for toolpath generation; (6) Iteration of possible conﬁgurations in CAM and RobotMaster interface; (7) Optimization and simulation of robot trajectory; and (8) Export KRL code and run program in KUKA. Due to robot work volume and reach limitations, stress-line-based paths are clustered into a series of separate print programs. Reasonable estimation of the KUKA arm’s limitation guides the global clustering of stress lines corresponding to different print surface orientation (Fig. 7.1), whereas geometric similarities guide the clustering of stress-line-based path internal to each surface orientation (Fig. 7.2). Next, the stress

lines assigned to each cluster are linked, and sequenced in a way that minimizes the KUKA’s total travel distance. (Fig. 7.3). Joint conﬁgurations and toolpath generation parameters may be altered to affect the ﬁlament quality. These quality determinants include: 1. Offset. To ensure a consistent quality in the printed ﬁlament and improved adhesion between ﬁlament and print surface, the offset between the nozzle and the printed surface is set at a level to allow the tip of the nozzle to drag along the top of the extruded ﬁlament uniformly across a stress curvature (doff in Fig. 8.1). 2. Extrusion activation timing. To mitigate the loss of ﬁlament due to a residual pressure gradient across the nozzle and to ensure the production of normalized ﬂow at the start of new stress-line-based paths, the ﬁlament is retracted immediately after the end of a tool path to break connection with the previous ﬁlament, and extruded again just prior to recommencing print for the following stress line (lst and lend in Fig. 8.1). 3. Travel and move rate. The robot’s movement is measured by its move rate, which differs from the actual travel rate of the extrusion tip over the print surface due to rotational requirement of the joints that are speciﬁc to the geometries of each stress-line-based path. Typically, decrease in the travel rate corresponds to the thickening of the deposited material, whereas increases may cause poor adhesion. 4. Tool axis orientation. 5-axis settings achieve the greatest consistency in the ﬁlament’s cross section proﬁle, thus leading to the best aesthetic and structural

performance. However, 4-axis settings can be used when joint rotational and collusion issues prohibit stress-line-based paths to be printed at complete normalcy (Fig. 8.3).

5 Results: Quality and Performance
Several surface topologies corresponding to common loading cases were produced for the 4-support grid shell case geometry. The superimposition of several layers of stress lines based on different loading conditions to induce additional structural resiliency was also explored. The SLAM methodology is relatively successful at achieving complex, structurally-meaningful geometries and topologies. To validate that SLAM-produced specimens perform better than conventionally 3D-printed parts, a comparative load test was completed on a number of specimens: three printed using the SLAM method, and four printed using a conventional layer-based 3D printer. The load test consists of a single centralized vertical point load that was applied until a peak load was reached (Fig. 10.1). MakerBot was selected as the technology to be compared to the SLAM method, as it is one of the most popular consumer-grade 3D printing platform available to designers that uses PLA plastic. An effort was made to ensure that all specimens have similar total material volume (Fig. 9). The MakerBot MB prints included both a solid constant-thickness shell (labelled M-C) and three variously-discretised shells, which include a random-generated (M-D.R), a stress-line-inspired (M-D.DL), and a grid-based topology (M-D.G). While the number of tests conducted is not high enough to be statistically conclusive, these preliminary results suggest that the SLAM method does lead to

improved structural performance, as indicated by the increase in ultimate load and improved ductility after initial failure, as shown in the normalized load-displacement plot (Fig. 10.2). The potential gain is particularly evident in the MB specimen with uniform thickness, where failures occurred in the shell where tensile stresses were predicted to occur (Fig. 10.3). More signiﬁcant advantages for the SLAM method are expected in complex geometries and loadings that induce more tension.

6 Discussion
There are several important directions for future work in SLAM that can be broadly categorized into four objectives: (1) Continue to investigate the material and strength behaviour of artefacts printed using the SLAM method; (2) Standardize and improve the SLAM procedures to achieve better precision; (3) Develop a computational framework to automate the generating stress-line-based structures and robot paths; and (4) Continue to explore and expand the design applications of SLAM. Considering that SLAM’s development was motivated by the recognition of anisotropy in artefacts printed using conventional FDM methods, future SLAM

research will continue to seek validation on the merits of oriented-ﬁlament deposition. Particularly, research is underway to conﬁrm the tension capacity of prints using the SLAM method, since the form-found 4-support grid shell geometry used in the initial implementation is not expected to experience signiﬁcant tensile stresses. Modiﬁcation on the boundary conditions of the grid shell, such as its supports and loading positions can signiﬁcantly induce greater tension in the system. The exploration of more complex surface geometries that are expected to experience both tension and compression can also provide a better understanding on the tensile strength properties of artefact printed using the SLAM method. Beyond the immediate time frame, signiﬁcant future milestones include the computational development of 3D-solid stress line computation, the elimination of the support structure, and the expansion of the extrusion module’s hardware capabilities, such as the incorporation of sensors to allow extrusion parameters to vary intelligently according to emergent conditions of the printed surface. These advances will open possibilities for free-form and real-time additive manufacturing, thus allowing technique to be implemented for more complexly curve 3D-surface design, and for full-scale construction.

7 Conclusion
The research pursued in this paper constitutes a promising ﬁrst step in validating a new approach to AM that synthesizes multi-axis machining capability and structural-led computation to enable the production of structurally-performative and geometrically-compelling 2.5D surface designs. Signiﬁcantly, structural load testing provided initial veriﬁcation that the proposed method outperforms methods using the conventional layer-based paradigm. The research also presented new strategies that speciﬁcally addressed the challenges of robotic manipulation at the prototyping scale. The most important contribution, however, is the demonstration of a new consolidated methodology encompassing parametric design, form-ﬁnding, structural optimization, robotic computation and digital fabrication, which uses robotic-integration to achieve a structurally-informed method of fabrication that provides designers with an opportunity to explore a fuller design space that considers both geometry and performance.
