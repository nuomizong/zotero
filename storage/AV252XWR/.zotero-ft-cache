An Evaluation of Finite Element Models of Stiffened Plates
by Ami Salomon

Submitted to the Department of Ocean Engineering on December 27, 2000 in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Master of Science in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering

Abstract Several ways to model stiffened plate structures using the finite element method are discussed. Special attention is given to the assumptions involved within each finite element model. The modeling capabilities of the relevant elements are investigated thoroughly by constructing and solving finite element models of simple cantilever beam structures. In particular, the influence of the depth of the web on the performances of the different modeling methods is examined. We evaluate three basic modeling methods, which differ by the way the stiffeners are modeled: two methods use beam elements (Hermitian and isoparametric beam elements) and the third uses shell elements. The displacement and stress solutions, obtained by these methods, are measured against solutions of a three-dimensional element model. We identify several limitations of the modeling methods under investigation, and we show that their performances are strongly depended on the depth of the stiffeners. We offer modifications to the different models, and we show them to be efficient for modeling stiffened plate structures with different boundary conditions. In particular, the modification of the classical and commonly used Hermitian beam elements is shown to yield excellent results.

1.1

Background

A stiffened plate structure is a common occurrence. Its application exists in various engineering structures; namely, ship hulls, offshore structures, rail/road bridges, aircraft structures, printed circuits boards and many others. In a stiffened plate, stiffeners may occupy any position depending on the design requirements. The objective is to make an efficient structural arrangement to sustain the externally applied forces with minimum material weight, by limiting the displacements and stresses to their permissible values. These stiffened plate structures are highly indeterminate in nature and as such they pose a great challenge to the analysts.

The different approaches available for the analysis of stiffened plate problems can be put under three broad categories: orthotropic plate model, grillages and plate-beam systems.

Huber [9] considered the orthotropic plate model in which the stiffened plate is replaced by a bare plate with orthotropic properties. This model, which is often referred to as the smearing technique model, is used efficiently if the stiffeners are small, identical and placed uniformly at close intervals. Identical stiffener profiles and equal spacing of stiffeners impose limitations on the use of this model and further, the evaluation of the stresses in the plate and in the stiffeners creates additional difficulties.

Idealization of a stiffened plate as a grillage starts with the assumption of an effective breadth of plating. According to various researches this effective breadth varies from 50% to 80% of the stiffener spacing. The comparatively complicated theories for plated grillages, as put forward by Kendrick [11] and Clarkson [5] have indicated that good results may be obtained for design work by a grillage calculation. This method of analysis gives deflections normally within 5% and occasionally within 10%, and the beam stresses vary generally within 10% to 20% of the experimental values.

10

The analysis of a stiffened plate structure as a plate-beam system, which reflects the true or near-true nature of the physical problem behavior, was enabled with the advent of digital computers, which resulted in attempts to solve the problem with numerical methods. Among the numerical methods, the finite element method is the most powerful one, and indeed great research effort was made in trying to achieve accurate and efficient finite element models for stiffened plates.

1.2

Recent efforts in the field of static finite element analysis of stiffened plates The field of static finite element analysis of stiffened plates was studied extensively

and much literature can be found on the subject. The following is a brief summary of some of the significant studies conducted in the recent years.

Cho and Vorus [4] proposed a three-dimensional method for analyzing stiffened plate structures. Their work was based on a formerly derived well-known method that uses two dimensional plane-stress elements and one-dimensional beam elements. The connection between the stiffeners and the plate is incorporated through constraints imposed on the relationship of rotational and translation displacements between the two element systems. In this model the displacement compatibilities of the beam and plate elements is satisfied only at the nodal points. The contacting shear compatibility condition along the elements is not maintained. The contribution of the authors was the modification of this model to allow for continuous shear transmission between the plate and the matching beam elements along the joining lines. This is done by imposing equal strain along the interface of the plate and the stiffeners, which leads to correction terms in the global stiffness matrix. The derivation of the correction terms is based on a simple case in which a complex beam is modeled by two beam elements, and hence the incorporation of the method to a stiffened plate structure requires the knowledge of the effective breadth of the plate, which is difficult to obtain accurately. The paper concludes with numerical examples in which a

I1 good performance of the modified method is reported.

Mukhopadhyay and Satsangi [13] developed isoparametric stiffened plate elements for the analysis of stiffened plate structures. The concept of a stiffened plate element is based on the projection of the stiffener stiffness to the nodes of the plate element. This approach enables flexibility in the analysis process, since the location of the stiffeners can be redefined, without changing the plate element mesh. The evaluation of the element matrices is based on the following assumptions: (i) the bending deformations follow Mindlin's hypothesis which allow shear deformation; therefore straight planes which are perpendicular to the mid-surface of the plate, remain straight but not normal to the deformed mid-surface; (ii) the deflection w in the z-direction is a function of x and y only; (iii) the stresses in the z-direction are assumed to be zero irrespective of the loading (plane stress condition); and (iv) the displacements of the points on the mid-surface in the normal direction to this plane is small in comparison to the thickness of the plane. The authors have shown that the element is capable of idealizing structures such as concentrically and eccentrically stiffened plates, but it is limited to modeling of orthogonal stiffened plates.

O'Leary and Harari [14] developed a stiffened plate finite element from a constraint variational principle, using Lagrange multipliers to impose the constraints between the stiffeners and the plate. In the development of the stiffened plate element, the bending and membrane behaviors are treated separately. The stiffness matrix of the plate was augmented by formulating the beam element stiffness with additional terms to impose the constraints between the stiffener and the plate. Even though the shear distortion is not included in the element formulation, the method was shown to be efficient and reliable in modeling thin flat plates reinforced with relatively widely spaced, heavy stiffeners.

Boot and Moore [3] attempted to identify the generalized conditions under which stiffened plates can be approximated as a two-dimensional orthotropic plate. This approximation is based on the concept of smoothed flexural, torsional and transverse shear rigidities. The authors obtained, by making suitable assumptions, a simplified set of

12 constitutive equations defining the stiffened plate problem, subjected to elastic behavior. The significance of these assumptions is investigated under a wide range of conditions, and the results calculated for typical problems using the simplified theory are compared with experimentally obtained data. The authors concluded that a two-dimensional approximation can be theoretically justified only if the stiffeners form an orthogonal network. They also concluded that the assumption of centroidal neutral axes is sufficiently accurate under arbitrary conditions for engineering purposes. However, the stresses generated in the stiffeners due to Poisson's ratio effects, which are normally ignored, may be significant.

1.3

Thesis area of concentration. As described above, a wide range of element types has been proposed for the

analyses of stiffened plates. However, we can identify three basic types of finite element models that are widely used by analysts, and are available in most of the finite element codes. These model types can be summarized as: I) orthotropic plate model, II) platebeam systems and III) models in which the stiffeners, as well as the plate, are built up from plate/shell elements. This thesis work concentrated on the evaluation of model types II) and III), compared with a full three-dimensional model.

The accuracy of solution of a physical problem model depends on the information contained in the mathematical (and therefore finite element) model that describes the physical problem. Since a real structure is obviously three-dimensional, only threedimensional elements can model the real physical problem without undertaking assumptions concerning the mechanics of the structure. The assumptions involved with the one- and two- dimensional elements lead to simpler and cheaper (in computer resources and engineering time) models, but also to lack of ability to predict some physical phenomena. The goal of this research is to conclude whether certain simplified finite element

13 models can provide satisfactory engineering results despite the assumptions involved in them. In the category of the plate-beam systems, two different types of models were investigated; in each type different beam elements and constraints between the beams and the plate were used. In both cases, the plate was modeled with flat shell elements. In the first plate and beam element model, Hermitian beam elements are used. These two-noded elements are formulated by solving the beam differential equations of equilibrium and hence yield the exact (within beam theory) solution of simple beam structures, even when a very coarse mesh is used (see detailed description of the element formulation in Section 3.1.2). The Hermitian beams are placed along the nodal lines of the shell elements, in the plane of the plate. The eccentric position of the stiffeners in the real structure is modeled by assigning an offset value to the beam elements, which results in constraints between the beam and the shell degrees of freedom. In the second plate and beam element model, isoparametric beam elements are used. These elements are formulated using the virtual work principle, and the differential equilibrium equations are not satisfied exactly. As a result, the solution of the mathematical model (see Section 2.1) is approached only when a relatively large number of elements is used. The isoparametric beam elements (which are referred to as "isobeam" elements below) can have one or two internal nodes along the element, and hence better (relative to the Hermitian beam elements) compatibility can be obtained with shell elements that have internal nodes along the edges. The iso-beam elements are constrained to the plate by rigid links: the nodal displacements of the beam element are made to undergo the displacements prescribed by the corresponding nodes of the shell element.

The second general type of models that was investigated (marked as model type III above) is the "all-shell" model, in which the stiffeners (as well as the plate) are built up from shell elements. This type of models is obviously more expensive in computer resources and engineering time than models which use beam elements to model the stiffeners, but they are a better representation of the real physical problem.

14 The performances of the models described above were compared with a threedimensional model. The use of a three-dimensional model is extremely expensive (about one order of magnitude more expensive in computer resources than a two-dimensional model), and hence it is rarely used to model stiffened plates. As mentioned above, the formulation of a general three-dimensional element is free from a priori kinematic structural assumptions about the material particle behavior (of course, the finite element displacement assumptions are present) and hence an assembly of three-dimensional elements can be an excellent replica of nature, provided that the mesh of the elements is fine enough. For this reason, three-dimensional models were constructed and solved for each variation of the stiffened plate structure that was analyzed by the simplified finite element models, in order to obtain a "reference solution" with which the solutions could be compared.

In order to gain insight into the modeling capabilities of the different elements, some simple geometries of cantilever beams (with various cross-sections) were examined. The cantilever beams were modeled using the same modeling methods as in the case of the stiffened plate analysis (see detailed description in Chapter 4). The study using the beam geometries led to several conclusions that proved to be valuable for the analysis of a stiffened plate structure.

The performances of the models were investigated with different stiffener depths. It was found that the accuracy of the various modeling methods is strongly dependent on the depth of the stiffeners.

Finite element formulation and assumption

2.1

Physical problem s mathematical models and finite element solution Figure 2-1 (taken from [2]) summarizes the finite element solution process. This

process is usually used to solve physical problems such as structures subjected to certain loads. We use assumptions to idealize the physical problem as a mathematical model, which is stated by a set of differential equations, and we use the finite element procedure to solve the mathematical model. It is important to note that only the selected mathematical model is solved by the finite element method, and hence the accuracy with which the physical problem is modeled is totally governed by the mathematical model that we choose to use. Even the most refined mesh cannot contain all the information that exists in the real physical problem, and hence the solution of the mathematical model can only give us an approximation of the real response.

We choose the mathematical model according to the phenomena we want to predict (small deflections, nonlinear response, etc.), and we must make sure that we choose reliable and effective models. A reliable model is one that predicts the required response within a selected level of accuracy. An effective model is one that yields the required response at relatively low cost.

The reliability and effectiveness of a given model can be examined versus a solution of a more comprehensive model of the same physical problem. In general, the most comprehensive model that can be thought of is a three-dimensional model that also includes nonlinear effects. Therefore, it may be necessary to solve higher-order mathematical models in order to asses the solution of the chosen model.

17 As discussed in details in the following chapters, a beam structure can be analyzed by a sequence of such mathematical models. The beam may first be analyzed using Bernoulli beam theory, then Timoshenko beam theory, then two-dimensional plane stress theory, and finally using a full three-dimensional continuum. Such a sequence of models is referred to as a hierarchy of models. It is obvious that a model higher in the hierarchy yields to a more accurate prediction of nature, but it is also more expensive in computer resources and engineering time. In most common cases, a full three-dimensional analysis is about an order of magnitude more expensive than a two-dimensional solution. We can summarize the basic steps in the process of analysis using finite elements as the proper choice of the mathematical model, the solution of the model by finite element procedures and the evaluation of the results. We must judge, for each finite element analysis, if an appropriate mathematical model was chosen (in light of the characteristics of the physical problem) and if the model was solved to sufficient accuracy.

2.2

General finite element formulation In this section we begin by stating the general elasticity problem to be solved. We then

discuss the principle of virtual displacements, which is the basis of the finite element solution, and we describe the derivations of the finite element equations. It should be mentioned that in the following we use the approach given in [2].

2.2.1

Problem statement

Figure 2-2 (taken from [2]) shows a general three-dimensional body that will serve to demonstrate the general problem to be solved. The body is supported on the area Su with prescribed displacements U su and is subjected to surface loads (force per unit area) on the surface area Sf.

In (2.6) C is the stress-strain material matrix and the vector r' indicates initial stresses. The problem to be solved is now defined by the geometry of the body, the applied loads, the boundary condition, the material law and the initial stresses. Our objective is to obtain the displacement field, and by doing so to derive the strains and stresses.

20 In the following we assume linear analysis conditions, which require that the displacements are infinitesimally small. A consequence is that we can express the equilibrium of the body with respect to its unloaded configuration with the calculation of the strains by (2.4). We also require that the relation between the strains and stresses is constant (not dependent on the loading or stresses), although it might vary inside the body.

2.2.2

The principle of virtual work

The principle of virtual work (also known as the principle of virtual displacements) is the basis of the displacement-based finite element procedures. It states that the equilibrium of any general body requires that for any field of virtual displacements that the body virtually undergoes, the total internal virtual work is equal to the total external virtual work. This can be stated as
-

where U is the virtual displacement field and e indicates the virtual strains.

It is important to note that the body does not physically undergoes the virtual displacement field U, since this displacement field is totally independent of the actual loading. The virtual displacements are only used to invoke the equilibrium of the body, as stated above.

When the principle of virtual work is fulfilled for all allowable virtual displacement fields, the three fundamental requirements of mechanics namely, differential

equilibrium, compatibility and the stress-strain law are satisfied.

21 2.2.3 Finite element equations

The essence of the finite element analysis is the approximation of the body as an assemblage of finite elements, which are connected through the nodes at their boundaries. In each element, the displacements are assumed to be a function of the displacements at the nodes. Hence, for a given element m, we can write:

U(i)

(x Y, z) = H (") (x, y, z) U

(2.8)

where H (") is the displacement interpolation matrix, and U denotes the displacements at all nodal points, including those at the supports of the body. U is a vector of dimension 3N, where N is the number of the nodes of the element assemblage:

U T =[UI V, W,

U2 V2 W2

...

UN

N

WN

(2.9)

A typical finite element is shown in figure 2-2. The mesh of the complete body corresponds to the assemblage of all elements (or elements with different geometry) such that no gaps are left. It is important to note that the displacement field (and hence strains) within a given element is influenced only by the displacements of the nodes of this element. The strains that correspond to the displacement vector U are:

e " (x, y, z) = B('" (x, y, z) 0

(2.10)

where B(") is the strain-displacement matrix, constructed by using the relations in (2.4). The stress vector can be stated as:

T(") = CW"E ('")+rI(n)

(2.11)

22
where C"' is the stress-strain matrix of element m and r() denotes the initial stresses.

The material law (which is specified in C&")) can vary within the element assemblage.

We can now derive the equilibrium equations that correspond to the finite element assemblage, by rewriting (2.7) as a sum of integration over the volume and areas of all finite elements:

(2.12)

where m=1,2,... ,k

24 2.3 Some aspects of the finite element formulation In the following we discuss some aspects concerning finite element formulations and we distinguish between several groups within the family of finite elements. In Chapter 3, where we describe the formulation of the elements that were used along the course of this research, we revisit these formulation aspects.

2.3.1

Truss and beam elements versus general two- or three- dimensional elements.

* Truss and beam elements.

Originally, the truss and beam element assemblages were not referred to as finite element models since the exact (within beam theory) stiffness matrices of these elements can be calculated by solving the differential equations of equilibrium of the elements rather than by using the principle of virtual work. As a result, all three requirements of an exact solution (the stress equilibrium, the compatibility, and the constitutive are fulfilled, and hence the exact element internal displacement and

requirements)

stiffness are calculated.

* General two- and three- dimensional finite elements. We use the principle of virtual work to formulate the stiffness matrix of two- and three- dimensional finite elements. Since we do not know the exact displacement variation (as in the case of a beam element) we use various functions that approximate the actual displacements. As a result, the differential equations of equilibrium are not satisfied, but this error vanishes as we refine the mesh.

25 2.3.2 Generalized coordinates finite elements versus iso-parametric finite elements.

In the discussion below we distinguish between two methods that serve to assemble the finite elements matrices: generalized coordinates and iso-parametric formulations. The first method enhance the understanding of the finite element method, while the other is more effective in most practical analyses. It should be mentioned that in the discussion below we use the finite element matrices derivations given in [2].

e Generalized coordinates finite elements

The derivation of the generalized coordinate finite elements is based on the approximation of the element displacements as polynomials in x,y and z with

undetermined constant coefficients a,, coordinates. In the general case we have:

Qj

and y , i=1,2,..., referred to as generalized

u(x, y, z)=a, +a 2 x+a

v(x, y,z)=

1

8 2x+,83 y+/34 z+

(2.22)

w(x, y,z) = 71 + 72 X+ y +Y 4z+YSXY+ 3

where a,

,

, and y, are the generalized coordinates. The relation in (2.22) can be written

in matrix form,

.

u =cDa

(2.23)

where (D contains the polynomials terms, and a is a vector of the generalized coordinates. In order to state the generalized coordinates as functions of the nodal point displacements, we evaluate the relation in (2.23) for U^ (which denotes the displacements at the nodes):

26 u =A-a
(2.24)

If A is not singular, we get:

a=

U.

(2.25)

The generalized strain vector is given by: (2.26)

e = Ea

where the terms in the matrix E are obtained by using the displacement approximation given in (2.22). The stresses -r are obtained by: (2.27)

r = CE

From (2.23) to (2.27), we obtained all the terms needed for the evaluation of the finite element matrices. Using the notation of Section 2.2, we have: H = OA-1

(2.28)

B = EA-'

(2.29)

* Iso-parametric elements.

The essence of the iso-parametric finite element formulation is the direct relationship between the element displacements at any point in the element and the element nodal point displacements, which is established through the use of interpolation functions. As a result, there is no need to calculate the transformation matrix A' [see (2.25)]; Instead, the element matrices are obtained directly.

27 The element coordinates and displacements are expressed in the form of an interpolation using the natural coordinate system of the element. This coordinate system may be one-, two-, or three dimensional, depending on the dimensionality of the element. Considering a general three-dimensional element, the coordinate interpolations are:

q

x

= Xhxj;
i=1

y=
=

-

hjyj;

z=
=

hizi

(2.30)

where x, y and z are the coordinates at any point in the element, and xi, yi, z, i=l,.. are the coordinates of the q element nodes. The interpolation functions hi are defined with the variables of the natural coordinate system of the element. These variables - vary from -1 r, s and t to +1. We use only the r variable in the case of the one-dimensional

element, r and s for two-dimensional elements and r,s,t for a three-dimensional case. The principal property of a certain interpolation function, say hi, is that its value is unity at node i and zero at all the other nodes of the element. This fundamental property enables a systematic derivation of the interpolation functions.

The element displacements are interpolated using the same method:

U=

; i=1

vhiuj hivj ; = i=1

= i=1

hiwi

(2.31)

where u, v, and w are the displacements at any point in the element and ui, vi and wi, are the displacements at the nodes.

In order to evaluate the element stiffness matrix, we have to calculate the strain displacement transformation matrix. We obtain the element strains via derivatives of the element displacements with respect to the local coordinates. Since these displacements include natural coordinate variables, we need to relate the x,y,z derivatives to the r,s,t derivatives. We can rewrite (2.30) as:

28 x = f, (r, s,t); y = f 2 (r,s,t); z = f3 (r,s,t) (2.32)

where the fi imply that x, y and z are functions of the natural coordinate variables. We obtain the required derivatives, I , and dz by using the chain rule:

L/r 1

d/dt]
=

x/dr ay/dr az/dr d/dx

dx/ds dy/ds az/ds

d/dy d/dz _

(2.33)

Lax/at

ay/at

az/dt

or in a short matrix form,

-= J ar ax -

(2.34)

where J is the Jacobian operator. Since we need the derivatives with respect to the local coordinates, we use:

ax

dr

(2.35)

The inverse of J exists if there is a unique relation between the natural and the local coordinates of the element, as expressed in (2.32). Using (2.31) and (2.35), we evaluate the derivatives of the displacements, and construct the strain-displacement transformation matrix B, with (2.36)

. = Ba

where

a

denotes the element nodal point displacements. The element stiffness matrix is

then given by

29
K = BC TCBdV
V

(2.37)

Since the terms in B are functions of the natural coordinates, the volume integration is conducted over the natural coordinate volume. Hence, the volume differential dV must also be written in terms of the natural coordinates:

dV = det(J)dr dsdt

(2.38)

where det (J) is the determinant of the Jacobian operator in (2.34).

Assumptions involved with relevant elements

The understanding of the mechanical assumptions involved in each finite element used in a finite element analysis is essential for an educated judgment of the results obtained by the finite element solution. In this chapter, we discuss the assumptions involved with the elements that were used along the course of the research work. As briefly described in Section 1.3, three types of elements were used during the thesis work: beam elements (including two sub-types: Hermitian beams and

isoparametric beams), shell elements and three-dimensional elements. In the following we discuss the assumptions involved with the beam and the shell elements, and we present brief descriptions of the element formulations. It should be noted that there are no structural assumptions involved with the three-dimensional elements, a fact that enables excellent modeling capabilities but also leads to high cost in computer resources and engineering time.

3.1

Beam elements

We begin the beam elements description with a discussion of general beam considerations. These considerations relate to both beam element types (Hermitian and isoparametric [or in short "iso"] beam elements) that are presented afterwards.

3.1.1

General beam considerations

The classic bending analysis does not account for shear deformation. As a result, a normal to the neutral axis of the beam stays straight during and after deformation, and its rotation is equal to the rotation of the beam neutral axis. This hypothesis, which relates to the Bernoulli beam theory, is illustrated in Figure 3-la (taken from [2]). The above

assumption results into the well-known differential equation in which the transverse displacement w is the only variable.

The inclusion of shear deformations corresponds to Timoshenko's beam-bending theory. According to this theory, a normal to the neutral axis stays straight, but due to
shear deformation it does not remain perpendicular to the neutral axis. As shown in

Figure 3-ib, the total rotation of such a fiber is the difference between the rotation of the tangent to the neutral axis and the shear deformation,

#=

dw Y dx

(3.1)

where / is the shear strain across the section. The actual shear strain varies across the section, and hence the shear strain y in (3.1) is an equivalent constant strain over a corresponding shear area As,

32
V

r=-; As

y=-; As =kA G

(3.2)

where V is the shear force at the section. Various hypotheses may be used in order to evaluate the shear correction factor, k (see [18] for details). One possibility is to assume that when acting on A,, the equivalent shear stress must result in the same shear strain energy as the actual shear stress acting on the real cross-sectional area A. As shown in [18], this procedure leads to k=5/6 for a rectangular cross-section.

3.1.2 3.1.2.1

Hermitian beam element General description

The Hermitian beam element is formulated by solving the beam differential equations of equilibrium (see discussion in Section 2.3.1). As a result, all three requirements of exact solution - namely, the stress equilibrium, the compatibility, and the constitutive requirements are fulfilled, and the exact ("exact" within beam theory) element stiffness and displacements are obtained. The Hermitian beam is a 2-node element with a constant cross-section and 6 degrees of freedom at each node (see Figure 3-2). The displacements modeled by the beam element are cubic transverse displacements, linear longitudinal displacement and linear torsional displacement. Off-centered beams can be modeled by using an offset definition.

3.1.2.2

Formulation of Hermitian beam element. In the following we describe the formulation of the Hermitian beam element using

the approach presented in [16]. We describe the formulation for an element representing a straight beam with uniform cross-section, which can carry axial forces, bending moments and twisting moments. The various forces and moments acting on the beam are the axial forces F, and F 7 ; shearing forces F 2 , F 3, F8 and F9 ; bending moments F5 , F 6, Fit and F 12 ; and twisting moments (torques) F 4 and F 10 . The location and positive directions of these

Figure 3-2: Hermitian beam element (taken from [16]). forces are shown in Figure 3-2. The corresponding displacements ul,...,U12 are taken to be positive in the positive directions of the forces. In the following we assume that the axial forces act along the centroidal axis of the beam, and that the shearing forces and the bending moments act in the planes of the principal axes of the beam's cross-section. Consequently, the shearing forces and the bending moments that act in the x-y plane (F2 ,F8 , F6 and F 12 ) yield displacement that are decoupled from the shearing forces and bending moments in the x-z plane (F 3 Flo, F5 and F,1 ). As a result, all forces (F1 to F 12 ) can be divided into six groups, which can be treated independently of each other. Considering each group separately, we derive the corresponding stiffness terms, which together assemble the element stiffness matrix as described below. ,

* Axial forces (F1 and F 7

If rz/l and r/l are small relative to unity, as is t he case with a thin beam, we can neglect the shear deformation and hence the terms 'Dy ar d Dz in (3.47) are set to zero.

3.1.3

Iso-beam element

The iso-beam element is formulated by using the virtual work principle with functions that approximate the actual displacements. As a result, the differential equations of equilibrium are not satisfied exactly, but the error reduces as the mesh is refined. In the following we describe the formulation of the iso-beam element, as given in [2]. The formulation of the iso-beam element is derived using the principle of virtual work discussed above. This is demonstrated below using a simple case of a twodimensional element with rectangular cross section, as shown in 3-7. The beam is subjected to transverse loading p and moment loading m, both per unit length. Applying the principle of virtual work with the assumptions discussed in section 3.1.1 we get:

Comparison between Hermitian and iso-beam elements

Since both the isoparametric beam and the Hermitian beam elements can be used to model beam structures, we may ask which element should be preferred. It is clear that in the case of linear analysis of straight beams the Hermitian elements are more costeffective, since they can describe cubic variations of displacements with half the degrees of freedom. However, the isoparametric beam element predicts the shear deformation more accurately, and enables a natural representation of curved beams. In the analyses of stiffened plates and shells the use of isoparametric elements may be effective, since the number of nodes along the isoparametric beam can be set to fit the number of nodes on the shell element edge (when the 4-, 8- or 16-node shell element is employed, the isoparametric element is employed with 2,3 and 4 nodes).

47
3.2 Shell elements

During the course of this research work, shell elements were used extensively,

both in the "all-shell" models, where only shell elements are present, and in hybrid
models, where the shell elements are assembled with different types of beam elements.

In the various finite elements models that were constructed and solved, we used flat rectangular shell elements, which are a special case of the general curved shell element. Therefore, we shall limit the discussion about the mechanics and formulation of the shell elements to the special case of flat rectangular elements.

In the following we describe the formulation of a flat shell element using the

approach given in
superimposing the

[2]. A simple rectangular flat shell element can be obtained by
plate bending behavior and the plane stress behavior. This

superposition and the resulting element are shown in Figure 3-9. We designate the

bending stiffness matrix of the element as K Band the membrane stiffness matrix as Km. Using these matrices we can assemble the total stiffness matrix

A study of element modefinig capabilities: analysis of cantilever beams

4.1

The purpose of this study

In order to gain insight into the modeling capabilities of the different elements, various simple models of beams were constructed and solved. The conclusions obtained by the solution of these simple models were found valuable for the analysis of the stiffened plate structure. The demonstrating models included the cantilever beams with "I" and "T" crosssections, described in Figure 4-1. The beams were subjected to bending and torque by means of a concentrated force and a concentrated moment at the tip. The analysis included the solution of deflections and stresses. First, a three-dimensional model was constructed and solved, in order to obtain a reference solution. This model's solution was compared to the well-known analytical solutions by Bernoulli and Timoshenko. Then, the other modeling methods were examined by comparison to the three-dimensional model. The next step was to investigate the influence of the depth of the web on the performance of the different models.

Different cross-section types ("T" and "I") were used in order to see whether the conclusions about the modeling capabilities would be valid for more general cases. The "T" cross-section is more attractive since its components, the web and the flange, resemble the components of the stiffened plate: the stiffener and the effective breadth of the plate, above each stiffener. However, the experiments using both types of crosssections yielded the same conclusions about the modeling capabilities.

Finite elements models.

The "T" beam was modeled using four different methods, as described in Figure 4-2. The formulation of the various elements is discussed in Chapter 3. The following is a description of the models, by decreasing order of mathematical hierarchy: 1). "Three-dimensional model" - constructed from solid elements with 20 nodes per element. The three-dimensional model is the most comprehensive of all mathematical models. The major disadvantage of the usage of the three-dimensional model is the cost in computer resources. For many engineering problems the usage of less comprehensive models will be adequate, and there is no need to use three-dimensional solid elements. 2). "All shell model" - constructed from 8-node shell elements. 3). "Iso beam model"
-

a combination of 3-node iso-beam elements with 8-node shell

elements. The Iso-beam element nodes are connected to the shell element nodes by means of rigid links. Rigid links are special constraint equations between two nodes - a master node and a slave node. As the nodes displace due to deformation, the slave node is constrained to translate and rotate such that the distance between the master node and the slave node remains constant, and that the rotations at the slave node are the same as the corresponding rotations at the master node. 4). "Hermitian beam model" - a combination of a Hermitian beam element (2-nodes per element by definition of the Hermitian beam element) and 4-node shell elements. The

low order (4-node) shell elements were used in order to have compatibility (as per the nodes, but not by the displacement functions) with the 2-node Hermitian beam elements. The Hermitian beam elements are in the flange plane, and hence are sharing the nodes of the shell elements. The fact that the web is eccentric to the flange surface is taken care of by definition of an offset value. The "I" cross-section beam served to further investigate particular issues, as described below, and was modeled using the "all-shell" and the "Iso-beam" methods.

4.3

Summary of results A bending load case (applied by a tip force) was solved using the various modeling

methods. This load case solution was the basis for the evaluation of the various models. First, the cross-section described in Figure 4-la was modeled. This beam will be referred to below as the "reference beam". Then, a further investigation on the influence of the web depth was conducted. Displacement and stresses (both axial and shear) were studied using each model.

60 We begin the results summary with the three-dimensional solution. This solution, together with some analytical results, will be used for the evaluation of the other modeling methods.

4.3.1

Three-dimensional model - the reference solution

As mentioned above, the reference beam was analyzed with a tip load. Figure 4-3 describes the comparison of the three-dimensional solution with the well-known solutions based on Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theory. The analytical beam theory solutions do not coincide with the three-dimensional solution (which is a better representation of the real beam): the Bernoulli beam is too rigid, while the Timoshenko beam is too flexible. The discrepancies are due to the assumptions involved with these theories. Bernoulli's classic beam theory does not account for deflections due to shear strain, and assumes that planes originally normal to the neutral axis remain plane and normal during deformation. This assumption introduces a constraint that does not exist in reality. The Timoshenko theory, which includes (in a simplified manner) deflections caused by shear strain, assumes that planes remain plane, but no longer normal to the neutral axis. The latter assumption relaxes the constraint used in the Bernoulli theory. The Timoshenko theory yields slightly larger displacements than the three-dimensional model, since it does not include the three-dimensional material effect (Poisson's effect) near the fixed end of the beam. It should be noted that this is true also for the Bernoulli beam theory, which nevertheless yields smaller deflections than the three-dimensional model

model") yields substantially smaller deflections than the three-dimensional solution. The reason for it lies in the nature of the model's definition, as explained below. As demonstrated in Figure 4-2a, the Hermitian beam elements are placed in the plane of the shell elements. The fact that the actual beam in the real structure is eccentric (located on one side of the plate) is taken into account by a definition of an offset value. The apparently natural definition of the offset value is the distance between the midsurface of the plate and the centroid of the web, as demonstrated in Figure 4-5a (noted as
doriginai).

Although it seems natural, this definition of the offset will result in an erroneous

representation of the beam (too-rigid model) since the fibers of the cross-section representedby the Hermitian beam and the shell elements will bend about the midsurface of the plate and not about the real neutral axis of the cross- section, which is somewhere

in-between the midsurface of the plate and the centroid of the web. Hence, when the use of the Hermitian beam is considered, the offset of the beam centroid from the location of the nodes should be adjusted such that the combination of the elements will yield the real moment of inertia. below. Since the moments of inertia of the flange and the web are well modeled by the elements, the offset value should be calculated in such a way that it compensates for the fact that both the flange and the web are bent about an axis that is not their own centroids. We shall now derive the expression for the modified offset. The moment of inertia of the cross section is given as: This value of offset should be calculated separately, as explained

(4.2)

where the definition of

dorigina

is given in Figure 4-5a. The expression in (4.2) is clearly

different from the one given in (4.1), and hence needs to be adjusted. The adjustment is done by a variation of the offset value, namely, by deriving a modified value of the offset such that the expressions in (4.1) and (4.2) will yield the same result. By equating (4.1) and (4.2) and dropping identical terms from both sides we get:

(44) 44

This way, we obtain a value that is smaller than the actual distance between the midsurface of the plate and the centroid of the web. Once the adjusted offset value is entered into the model, the results are close to those obtained using the three-dimensional model and the analytical beam theories (see Figure 4-4).

4.3.2.2 Predicted stresses Figure 4-6 depicts the bending stress in the reference beam, at the bottom of the web. It can be noted that the original Hermitian model yielded substantially smaller stresses than the three-dimensional model or the analytical beam theory solution (maximum error of -38.5%, relatively to three-dimensional model). Once the Hermitian model was defined using the adjusted offset, the correct stresses were obtained. Figure 4-7 depicts the shear stress due to bending in the web of the reference beam. It can be seen that the Hermitian beam models (both the original and the modified models) yield a constant shear stress across the web, as opposed to the quadratic analytical solution pattern (which is also observed in the three-dimensional and all shell models). Furthermore, the Hermitian models do not predict correctly the distribution of the shear force over the whole cross-section area. They predict that about 75.9% of the shear force is carried by the web, while the analytical solution gives a value of 93.4%. We can conclude that the assumption of constant shear stress in the Hermitian beam element (see derivation of the element formulation in Section 3.1.2) leads to erroneous shear force (and hence stress) prediction in the stiffeners.

66 4.3.3 4.3.3.1 Iso beam model Predicted displacements

As opposed to the Hermitian beam model, the iso-beam model does not use an offset definition. Instead, the iso-beam element nodes lie on a line located at the natural axis of the web. The displacements predicted by the iso-beam element model are very close to those obtained by the three-dimensional model - see Figure 4-4.

4.3.3.2 Evaluation of stresses The bending stresses, as obtained by the iso-beam model, are very close to the threedimensional and analytical solutions, as described in Figure 4-6. Similar to the Hermitian model, the iso-beam model predicts an erroneous constant shear stress pattern in the web (see Figure 4-7). This leads to a wrong shear force taken by the web: 20.3% of the total shear force instead of 93.4% obtained by the analytical solution. We can conclude that the rigid link connection between the shell elements and the iso beam elements cannot model correctly the distribution of shear force over the cross section. This error, in predicting the shear force distribution repeats for the "I" cross-section case, where the iso-beam model predicts that 65.9% of the shear force is carried by the web, while the analytical solution gives that 91.6% of the force is carried by the web.

4.3.4 4.3.4.1

All shell model Predicted displacements

In general, the construction of a model of a beam of arbitrary cross-section using only shell elements, results in a geometric error due to the overlapping that occurs in the intersection between the shell elements. This applies for the "T" cross-section, as can be seen in Figure 4-8. The analyst may approach the problem by several ways, as described below.

. Cross-section definition - approach no. 1. The first approach, which is most likely used, is depicted in Figure 4.8b and results into a "too rigid" cross-section. In this approach, the depth of the web is defined as the real web depth plus half of the plate thickness. The model is then too rigid, due to the extra segment of the web in the overlapping area, and hence smaller deflections are predicted. The error is relatively small: about 1.3% of discrepancy from the threedimensional solution (see Figure 4-9).

. Cross-section definition - approach no. 1 - influence of the web's depth.

The discrepancies of the "too rigid" model relatively to the three-dimensional model vary with the depth of the web, diminishing as the web depth approaches very large values. This follows from the fact that the error of having an extra portion of the web inside the half thickness of the plate has a negligible contribution to the total moment of inertia, when the web depth is very large. The error in the "too rigid" model approaches (from below) a final value when the web depth approaches zero, due to the contribution of the extra portion of the web in the half thickness of the plate.

. Cross-section definition - approach no. 2. Another possible approach to tackle the problem is to define the distance between the midsurface of the flange and the bottom of the web as the value of the real height of the web - see Figure 4.8c. This approach leads to a too-flexible model (relative to the real structure) due to the reduction of the offset of the web, and as a result, reduction of the cross-sectional moment of inertia. This model has a substantial error compared to the exact solution: for the reference beam, the tip deflection has an error of 14% relative to the analytical solution.

. Cross-section definition - approach no. 2 - influence of the web's depth.

As for the "too rigid" model definition, the value of the discrepancy varies with the depth of the web, and has a maximum value (about 70%) at the point where the bending stiffness of the flange and the web are equal - see Figure 4-9. This is due to the relative influence of the incorrect location of the web on the overall bending stiffness of the cross section. When the bending stiffness of the flange is very large compared to the web, the contribution of the web to the overall stiffness is relatively small. Hence, the fact that the

69 web is misplaced has a minor importance. The same reasoning applies when the web stiffness is much larger than that of the flange: the cross section is mainly the web, so the relative location between the flange and the web has little importance. Once both the flange and the web make similar contributions, then the moment of inertia of the whole cross-section is affected in a dramatic way. The maximum discrepancy between the "too flexible" model and the reference solution is smaller if the flange (which is kept fixed while the web's depth is varied) is larger. This is due to the fact that a deeper web is needed in order to match the stiffness of the flange - and hence the real distance between the mid-surface of the flange and the centroid of the web will be larger. As a result, the error involved with the misplacement of the web will be relatively smaller, since the ratio between the actual offset and the real offset value is smaller for this case. This phenomenon is demonstrated with the "T" cross-section no. 2, described in Figure 4-lb. This "T" cross-section has a thicker and wider flange, and a thinner web. Hence, the maximum discrepancy has a lower value (about 43%), and it is obtained for a deeper web - see Figure 4-10.

* Cross-section definition - approach no. 3. In order to achieve a better representation of the cantilever beam using an all-shell element model, a third approach can be used. According to this approach, the depth of the web is defined such that the whole cross-section (web and flange) will have the same moment of inertia as the real cross section. The procedure to obtain the appropriate web depth is described below. The moment of inertia of the real cross-section is given by the following expression:

Depth of web Figure 4-12: Modified web depth and moment of inertia.

Figure 4-12 describes the ratio between the modified web depth (x) to the real web depth (h,). It can be noted that the depth of the modified web is very close to the depth of the real web. This means that the too-rigid all-shell model is only "slightly too rigid", as demonstrated in Figure 4-12 by the ratio of the moments of inertia. The modified all shell model, which uses the modified web depth, yields displacements that are very close to the three-dimensional model solution. The displacement solutions for the various web depths, as obtained by the modified all-shell model, are given in Figure 4-9 for the reference beam, and in Figure 4-10 for the wide flange "T" cross-section.

The too-rigid shell model solutions are about 1% smaller

Over-all comparison

The comparison of the displacement solution of the three-dimensional model to the solutions obtained with the other models, as a function of the depth of the web, is summarized in Figure 4-14. It can be seen that the modified "all shell" model solution is the closest to the three-dimensional model solution. The original "Hermitian model" solution error increases with the web depth since the distance between the mid-surface of the flange and the neutral axis of the cross-section is increasing, as the web becomes deeper. The modified "Hermitian model", the "Iso-beam model" and the modified all-shell model solutions are within 0.25% of the three-dimensional model solution in the

investigated range of cross-sections.

Conclusions reached from the analyses

The results obtained from the demonstrating problems lead to several conclusions, regarding the modeling of a stiffened plate structure. . Modeling a stiffened plate structure using a combination of Hermitian beam and shell elements. In a similar way to the modeling of a "T" cross-section, a stiffened plate model that is constructed from Hermitian beam and shell elements will be too rigid, if the value of the offset is not properly adjusted. It should be noted, though, that when modeling a stiffened plate, the error described above would be less significant, since the neutral surface of the stiffened plate is located close to the plate. However, one should be aware of the existence of the error, which may result in smaller deflections and stresses relative to those obtained by the threedimensional model.

76 . Modeling a stiffened plate using Hermitian or iso-beam elements, and shell elements. The results obtained from the analysis of cantilever beams demonstrated that models constructed from Hermitian beam or iso-beam elements with shell elements cannot predict correctly the flow of the shear stresses from the flange to the web. This is due to the lack of shear compatibility between the plate and beam elements.

. Modeling a stiffened plate using only shell elements. Construction of a model with intersecting shells, which are defined by their midsurfaces, will yield an error due to the overlapping zones - as demonstrated above. If the "too flexible" approach is used, the displacement solution will be substantially in error. The maximum error occurs when the bending stiffness of the stiffener is equal to the bending stiffness of the effective breadth of the plate. The effect on a stiffened plate structure is described in Section 5.

Analyses of stiffened plate

5.1

Introduction The main goal of the thesis research was to investigate different methods to model

stiffened plate structures, and to gain insight into the modeling capabilities of each method. The study of the modeling capabilities, as described in the last chapter, contributed to the understanding of the mechanics of each modeling method, and the ability to make several modifications in order to improve their performances. The modifications were proved to be efficient for the cantilever beam geometry, and herein they are examined for a stiffened plate structure.

The stiffened plate is described in Figure 5-1. The structure consists of a plate and two sets of orthogonal stiffeners and is subjected to a uniform pressure of 9800 [Pa], the equivalence of 1 [m] height of water column. Two boundary condition cases were examined: clamped and simply supported edges.

79 As already discussed in Chapter 4, the solution of a three-dimensional model provides the best prediction of the response of the real structure, since the model does not include pre-defined assumptions about the mechanics of the structure. Our objective is to evaluate the performances of the simplified finite element models (models number 1 to 3 from the list above) by comparing their solutions to the solution of the three-dimensional model. Doing so allows us to evaluate the predicted solutions of displacements and stresses. The comparison was conducted for different depths of stiffeners, in order to

generalize the conclusions derived from the investigation. We begin with the derivation of an approximate analytical solution to the physical problem. This solution served to assess the order of magnitude of the stiffened plate response, as obtained by the finite element model solutions.

5.2

Analytical solution

The analytical solution was obtained by solving the Huber equation for orthotropic plates. In the following we describe the analytical solution for the case of simply supported edges, where the different dimensions of the stiffened plate structure are as given in Figure 5-1, with stiffeners' depth of 0.1 [m].

Using MATHCAD, the different coefficients were calculated (in principle, the
L. coefficients should be calculated with n=m=1 oo, but a sufficient accuracy can be

obtained with n=m= 1..100), and the displacements W(x,y) were derived. Figure 5-4 describes the displacements of the structure, as obtained from the solution of the Huber equation. The maximum deflection (in the center of the plate, as can be expected) is 1.266*105
[M].

As discussed later, the three-dimensional model solution for the same physical problem yielded a maximum deflection of 2.941* 10- [m], which has the same order of magnitude as the result obtained by the analytical solution. Obviously, once we find that

the comprehensive finite element solution and the analytical solution are of the same order of magnitude, we should note that the finite element solution is more accurate (closer to reality), since it does not include the assumptions and approximations involved within the analytical solution.

5.3

Solutions of finite element models The response of the stiffened plate described in Figure 5-1 was investigated for two

boundary condition cases: clamped and simply supported edges. For each boundary condition case, a series of models of stiffened plates was constructed and solved. Each model was defined with different depth of stiffeners, which was varied from 0.1 [m] to 0.01 [m]. In the following, we focus on the evaluation of the displacement and stress solutions of the various models.

5.3.1

Clamped edges boundary condition.

The clamped boundary condition is modeled by fixing all the degrees of freedom at the outer edges of the plate and stiffeners: three degrees of freedom in the three-dimensional

-

83 model (three translations) and six degrees of freedom for all other models (three translations and three rotations).

* Predicted displacements

The maximum displacement of a stiffened plate structure subjected to a uniform pressure load is naturally obtained in the center of the plate. Figure 5-5 describes the

displacement in this location as obtained by the various models, for different depths of stiffeners. It can be noticed that all the models yielded similar results, except the "tooflexible" all-shell model, which yielded substantially larger (and erroneous)

displacements.

We evaluate the displacement solutions of the various models by comparison to the three-dimensional solution, as described in Figure 5-6. From this comparison a significant result arises: the modified all-shell model yields solutions that differ from the three-dimensional solution by up to 6.21%, a discrepancy which is larger (in absolute values) than the discrepancies of the iso-beam and the modified Hermitian models. This result might be thought of as surprising if we recall that for the cantilever beam case, that was covered in Chapter 4, the modified all-shell model yielded almost the same results as the three-dimensional model (within 0.09%). Furthermore, the "too-rigid" all-shell model, which can be expected to yield smaller displacements than the three-dimensional model, is found to be more flexible by up to 6.13%.

As can be noticed, the modified and the "too-rigid" all-shell models yielded almost the same solutions, which implies that the modified and "too-rigid" stiffener depths are very close (see definitions of modified and "too rigid" depth values in Figure 4-8). This is due to the nature of the modification method, which involves the width of the flange (or in the case of a stiffened plate, the width of the plate that is taken as the flange). As the width increases, the modified stiffener depth approaches the "too-rigid" value since the extra portion of the stiffener inside the plate has negligible contribution to the overall

85 bending stiffness, and hence the original all-shell model is not altered in a significant way. The discrepancy between the all-shell model displacement solutions and the threedimensional solution, is mainly due to the way in which the thickness of the plate and stiffeners is modeled. In the three-dimensional model the plate and stiffeners are modeled in a natural and accurate way that corresponds to the real three-dimensional geometry of the structure. In the all-shell models we represent the plate and the stiffeners by flat twodimensional shell elements, where the physical thickness of the real structure is defined separately from the definition of the geometry itself. This thickness definition is used in the element stiffness matrix calculation (see Chapter 3), and hence the mechanics of the real structure is, in general, represented accurately. The problem arises when we have intersections of shells: due to the two-dimensional nature of the shell elements they cannot predict three-dimensional effects that exist in nature. In the studied stiffened plate structure this phenomenon appears in the intersection between the stiffeners, and the intersection between the stiffeners and the plate. A twodimensional all-shell model cannot represent these intersections correctly, as demonstrated in Figure 5-7(a), since it cannot predict the influence of the thickness of the stiffener on the deformed shape of the plate (or the thickness of one stiffener on the deformed shape of another stiffener). This influence is well predicted by the threedimensional model as shown in Figure 5-7(b).

As a result of the lack of ability to predict three-dimensional effects, the all-shell models are too flexible and yield larger displacements than the three-dimensional model as shown in Figure 5-6. In order to further assess the effect of this phenomenon, a new modified all-shell model was defined: in this model rigid links were used to link the nodes of the plate under the stiffeners, in order to imitate the effect of the stiffeners' thickness. This new modified all-shell model yielded a displacement solution that is very close to the three-dimensional solution: for stiffener depth of 0.1 [m] the discrepancy of the maximum displacement was 0.4%. We can conclude that the way by which the

thickness of the stiffeners is modeled has a substantial effect on the displacements solution. All of the other models (iso-beam model, original and modified Hermitian beam model) contain the same problem, since they all use one- and two-dimensional elements, which cannot predict three-dimensional effects. Fortunately, the extra-flexibility introduced by this phenomenon is balanced by the extra-rigidity already existing in the Hermitian beam and iso-beam models, extra rigidity that is caused by the assumptions within the models. This balancing of the two influences leads to relatively good results of the modified Hermitian beam and iso-beam models, as shown in Figure 5-6.

In the iso-beam model, the extra rigidity is introduced by the rigid links that connect the beams to the plate (see Figure 5-2). The outcome of a rigid link is that one node (the "slave" node, in this case a given node along the beam) is constrained to translate so that the distance between it and another node (the "master" node, in this case the corresponding node in the plate) is constant, and further constrained to rotate with the same rotation as the master node. In the real physical problem, these constraints on the displacements of the material particles do not exist, of course, and hence extra-rigidity is introduced into the iso-beam model.

87 In the Hermitian beam models (original and modified) extra-rigidity is introduced by the fact that the shear-lageffect cannot be predicted. Let us discuss briefly the essence of the shear-lag phenomenon. Simple beam theory assumes that plane cross-sections remain plane, and that therefore the bending stress is directly proportional to the distance from the neutral axis. Thus in any flange-and-web type of beam the predicted stress is constant across the flange. However, in reality, the bending loads applied on the beam deflect the web to some radius of curvature, thus inducing large strain in the flange. Since it carries large strain, and hence large stress, the flange makes the significant contribution to the bending stiffness. It is important to note that this large strain comes initially from the web and only reaches the flange by shear. This is demonstrated in Figure 5-8, which shows a wide flange "T" beam loaded with a vertical force. The web deflects such that the upper and lower edges of the web are elongated and shortened. At the upper edge the elongated web pulls the plating with it, resulting into in-plane shear forces, which sets up shear stresses in the flange. The bending and shear stresses cause stretching and in-plane distortion of the flange. In the figure an element is shown before and after this distortion: the shear distortion is such that the outer edge of the element does not have to stretch as much as the inner edge. That is, the longitudinal strain is less at the outer edge and therefore so is the longitudinal stress. This same phenomenon will occur at each element, from the centerline to the edges, although it will diminish steadily and disappear at the edges because the shear stress diminishes to zero. The overall result is that the flange undergoes
in-plane longitudinal distortion and therefore plane cross-sections do not remain plane.

This distortion is commonly referred to as "warping" of the cross section. The most significant aspect of the shear distortion is that the outer portion of the flange carries less bending stress, and is therefore less effective than the inner portion. That is, due to shear effects, the bending stress remote from a web "lags behind" the stress near the web, and hence the phenomenon is termed "shear lag" effect. Shear lag is of importance in beams having very wide flanges and shallow webs, or in stiffened plates with wide spacing between the stiffeners.

Shear stresses

Figure 5-8: Shear lag in a wide flange "T" beam.

As mentioned above, the shear lag effect cannot be predicted accurately by the Hermitian beam model. This is a consequence of the way in which the model is constructed: the Hermitian beam elements are defined in the plane of the plate (see Figure 5-2), and hence the transmission of the longitudinal strains of the stiffeners to the plate by shear forces is not predicted. As a result, the whole breadth of the plate is effective in bending and extra-rigidity is introduced to the Hermitian beam model. As described in Section 4.3.2, the modified Hermitian beam is defined by adjusting the offset of the stiffener from the flange (or the offset of the web from the flange, in the case of the "T" beam model) such that the resulting combined section will have the same moment of inertia as the section of the real structure. Since the calculation of the adjusted offset involves the breadth of the plate, we can use an effective plate breadth in order to indirectly include the shear lag phenomenon in the model. The effective breadth of the plate for different types of structures and loadings cases may be found in various references (see [10] for example). The effective breadth of the stiffened plate analyzed herein, for the case of clamped edges, is 58% of the stiffeners spacing. By applying this approach to the analyzed stiffened plate, a new series of Hermitian beam models was constructed and solved. The displacement solutions obtained by these models (referred to as "modified Hermitian beam model, compensated for shear lag") are described in Figure 5-6. It can be noticed that by involving the shear lag

89 phenomenon in the models we obtain larger displacements, as expected. One should keep in mind that this approach only roughly approximates the shear lag phenomenon, and hence will not yield an accurate prediction of the effect obtained via three-dimensional model.

* Predicted stresses.

From the comparison of the various models on the basis of maximum deflection, we can conclude that the "too-flexible" all-shell model can not be considered as an appropriate model for the stiffened plate structure. Hence, the stress investigation was limited to the original and modified Hermitian beam models, iso-beam model, and the "too-rigid" and modified all shell models.

The bending stresses in the mid-span of the stiffeners (point A in figure 5-1) were investigated. Although the maximum stresses in a clamped stiffened plate subjected to uniform pressure are obtained at the clamped edges, the investigation of the stresses was focused on the mid-span of the stiffeners in order to isolate the influence of the singularities introduced by the sharp corners at the clamped edges.

Since the natural axes are located between the plate and the mid-depth of the stiffeners, the maximum bending stresses in the stiffeners are obtained in the fibers which are most remote from the plate. Due to the symmetry of the structure and loading, the same bending stress was obtained in all of the stiffeners. Figure 5-9 gives the stresses predicted by the various models, as a function of the depth of the stiffeners. It can be noticed that the three-dimensional model, all shell models and the iso-beam model predicted very similar results. Figure 5-10 shows the discrepancies in bending stresses between the threedimensional model and the rest of the models. As expected, the prediction of higher

Figure 5-10: Stiffened plate with clamped edges - evaluation of bending stresses.

91 displacements by the all-shell models (relative to the three-dimensional model) led to higher stress prediction, up to a maximum discrepancy of 2.9% for stiffener height of 0. 1[m].

The iso-beam model yielded higher stresses than the three-dimensional model for depth of stiffeners smaller than 0.05 [m], and lower stresses above this stiffener depth. This trend of the stress discrepancy resembles the trend of the displacement discrepancy of this model. The original Hermitian beam model yielded smaller stresses than the threedimensional model, with a maximum discrepancy of about -20%. It can be noted that the trend of the stress discrepancy is inverse to the trend of the displacement discrepancy: for depth of stiffeners of about 0.05 [m] the displacement discrepancy is the maximum, while the stress discrepancy is the least. This is due to the way in which the load is distributed between the stiffeners and the plate: when the stiffeners are modeled as too-stiff by the Hermitian beam model, the displacements are smaller but the relative percentage of the load carried by the stiffeners is larger, and so the predicted stresses are higher. The modified Hermitian beam yielded better results than the original Hermitian beam model, with a discrepancy (relative to the three-dimensional model) of about -5% for depth of stiffeners of 0.05[m] and above. A further improvement was obtained by compensating the Hermitian beam model for shear lag in the plate. These results

demonstrate the effectiveness of the modification process, when modeling stiffened plate structures with Hermitian beam elements.

5.3.2

Simply-supported boundary conditions

For the all-shell, iso-beam and Hermitian beam models, the simply supported boundary condition was applied by fixing only the translation degrees of freedom (and

92 enabling the rotations) at the edges of the plate. In the three-dimensional model, where only translation degrees of freedom exist, the nodes at the mid-thickness of the plate were fixed, such that rotations about the mid-thickness are enabled.

* Predicted displacements.

Figure 5-11 gives the displacements at the center of the plate, as obtained by the various models, for different depths of stiffeners. The figure also includes the solution of the approximated analytical solution presented in the beginning of the chapter. The discrepancies between the two- and three- dimensional model solutions are shown in Figure 5-12. The major observations made in the case of the clamped edges boundary condition repeat here: the modified and "too-rigid" all-shell models yield larger displacements than the three-dimensional model, with a maximum discrepancy of about 2.46% for depth of stiffeners of 0.1[im]. It can be noticed from Figure 5-12 that the maximum discrepancy of the "too-flexible" all-shell model is obtained for depth of stiffeners of 0.03 [m], while the maximum discrepancy of the same model with clamped edges boundary condition is obtained for depth of stiffeners slightly above 0.02 [in] (see Figure 5-6). The disparity is driven by the shear lag phenomenon which is well predicted by the all-shell models. The effective breadth of the plate depends on the distance between points of zero bending moment, which governs the radius of curvature of the deformed structure. Since in the clamped edges case the distance between points of zero bending moment is smaller, the effective breadth of the plate is smaller: 58% of the spacing between the stiffeners, compared with 71 % in the simply supported case. Since the maximum error of the "too-flexible" all-shell model is obtained when the bending stiffness of one stiffener is equal to the stiffness of the effective breadth of the plate, the difference in effective plate breadth leads to different depths of stiffeners for which a maximum discrepancy is obtained.

Depth of stiffeners Figure 5-12: Stiffened plate with simply supported edges - discrepancy of displacement solutions from the 3D model solution

94 The approximate analytical displacement solution, obtained by the equivalent orthotropic plate method, yields considerably smaller displacements than the three-dimensional model. Even tough, the approximated analytical solution, due to its simplicity, can be easily used to verify the order of magnitude of a given finite element solution.

* Predicted stresses.

As for the clamped edges case, the bending stresses in the mid-span of the stiffeners were investigated. Figure 5-13 gives the stresses obtained by the various models while Figure 5-14 shows the discrepancy of the various stresses solutions from the threedimensional solution. It can be noticed that the stress-discrepancy curves of the Hermitian beam models have an inverse trend to that seen in the displacementdiscrepancy of the same models, as shown in Figure 5-12. The same phenomenon was observed and discussed in the case of the clamped edges boundary condition case.

Concluding remarks

We have described several ways to model stiffened plate structures using the finite element method, and discussed in detail the assumptions involved with each finite element model.

The modeling capabilities of the various elements were investigated thoroughly by constructing and solving finite element models of a simple "T" beam structure. In particular, we examined the influence of the depth of the web on the performances of the different modeling methods. Using the knowledge gained from this investigation, it was possible to perform several modifications to the original modeling methods, in order to improve their performances. These improved modeling methods were shown to yield enhanced displacement and stress predictions.

We have shown that the solution of a stiffened plate model that uses a combination of Hermitian beam and shell elements predicts significantly smaller deflections and stresses than those obtained by the corresponding three-dimensional model. We have offered a modification to this model, based on the adjustment of the way in which the eccentricity of the stiffeners is defined. This modified modeling method was shown to yield good results when used for modeling stiffened plate structures, subjected to different boundary conditions.

We have also shown that a stiffened plate model that uses Hermitian beam elements to model the stiffeners cannot predict accurately the shear lag phenomenon. This is a consequence of the position of the Hermitian beam elements in the model: they are placed in the plane of the plate, and hence the local transmission of the axial strain from the edge of the stiffeners to the plate (the essence of the shear lag phenomenon) can not be predicted accurately. We have offered further modification to the Hermitian beam model, in order to accommodate the influence of the shear lag phenomena.

97 Using shell elements to model the stiffeners, as well as the plate, is known to yield a good replica of the physical problem. We investigated the influence of the depth of the stiffeners on the performances of these models, and concluded that the intuitive approaches to model the depth of the stiffeners may result in considerable errors in the predictions of the displacements and stresses. Maximum errors are obtained when the bending stiffness of a single stiffener is equal to the bending stiffness of the effective plate to which it is attached. We have offered a modification to this modeling method, based on the adjustment of the definition of the stiffeners' depth. This modified depth allows for the inherent inaccuracy present in the modeling of the plate and stiffeners intersections (or web and flange intersection in case of a beam) using the shell elements.

We have shown that finite element models that use two-dimensional elements, such as shell elements, cannot predict the effect of the thickness of the stiffeners on the deformed shape of the plate, and hence they predict larger displacements than the three-dimensional element model. We have demonstrated that the influence of the stiffener thickness can be introduced into the shell element model by imposing rigid links along the intersections between the plate and the stiffeners. However, this process requires a very fine mesh and hence is not practical for large finite element models.

It is important to note that this research included only static linear structural finite element analysis for beam and stiffened plate structures. Hence, we can recommend the use of the modified modeling methods discussed above only when static linear analysis is considered. Therefore, it is recommended that future research on these modeling methods for stiffened plate structures will examine their validity for nonlinear analyses (large displacements, buckling) and dynamic (transient) analyses.

As a summary, it should be mentioned that all of the modeling methods discussed in this thesis are adequate for the analyses of stiffened plates. The employment of the modifications suggested above to the various modeling methods will yield more accurate solutions but will also require more engineering time. The decision whether to apply these modifications should be made according to the required accuracy of the solution,

98 depending on the physical problem and the analyst judgment. For an analysis of a typical stiffened plate structure, such as a deck of a ship, the use of the Hermitian-beam model (once modified as described above) is recommended due to its attractive costeffectiveness.
