1. INTRODUCTION Since the time of mid-1960s when the forms of curved shell "nite elements were originated, including those developed by Professor Gallagher, the published literature on modelling of plates and shells in the linear and non-linear regimes and their application to dynamic or vibration analysis of structures has grown extensively. There has been a tremendous interest on the part of researchers with su$ciently large amount of resources devoted to the subject, and there continues to be innovative activity in computational shell mechanics. In the last three decades, numerous theoretical models have been developed and applied to various practical circumstances. It may be fair to state that no single theory has proven to be general and comprehensive enough for the entire range of applications. At times, generality has been sacri"ced to obtain better performance over certain class of physical problems with greater accuracy and e$ciency. At other times, accuracy of the schemes has been somewhat compromised to be able to address a wider range of

practical engineering problems. These needs have resulted in a signi"cant addition to the literature published on the subject. The computational implementation of shell elements has continued to challenge "nite element researchers. Several unresolved issues of the past have been settled over the years, and possible explanations of the strange behaviours of seemingly reasonable elements have been developed. Some of the pathologies that could not be explained mathematically eventually o!ered a rigorous solution, while others being investigated via numerical experimentation still ba%e the research community. In this paper, we endeavor to summarize the important milestones achieved by the "nite element community over the last decade and a half in the arena of computational shell mechanics. Work previous to this period was summarized in Reference [1]. We have tried to provide an extensive survey of the literature, however, because of the sheer magnitude of the literature available on the topic, this survey may not be exhaustive. In order to organize the literature, we "rst outline the main ideas that have categorized the various approaches available in computational shell analysis. In general, they can be listed as: (i) the degenerated shell approach, (ii) stress-resultant-based formulations and Cosserat surface approach, (iii) reduced integration techniques with stabilization (hourglass control), (iv) incompatible modes approach, (v) enhanced strain formulations (mixed and hybrid formulations), (vi) elements based on the 3-D elasticity theory, (vii) drilling degrees-of-freedom elements, (viii) co-rotational approaches and (ix) higher-order theories for composites. It is to be noted that any successful shell element is, in fact, a combination of more than one of the techniques outlined above. Consequently, in a general setting, these approaches are interrelated and discussing any one in isolation from the others may not be thorough enough. However, in order to keep the discussions manageable, we choose to follow this organization, and use our judgmental discretion in designating an element to a particular category. We must clarify that such designations are by no means to be viewed as rigid. We also seek the pardon of those authors whose works were not mentioned here due to our negligence.

2. THE DEGENERATED SHELL APPROACH Over the past two decades, computational shell analysis has been, to a large extent, dominated by the so-called degenerated solid approach, which "nds its origins in the paper of Ahmad et al. [2]. The popularity of these elements is due, in part, to their simplicity of formulation by which the traditional classical shell theories are circumvented. The element is derived directly from the fundamental equations of continuum mechanics. Besides, its implementation in the "nite element procedures is straightforward. While the basic concept underlying the degenerated element is very simple, these elements are generally expensive in computation and, therefore, their application to material non-linear problems, in particular, can be limited. The works of, among others, Ramm [3], Hughes and Liu [4, 5], Hughes and Carnoy [6], Bathe and Dvorkin [7], Hallquist et al. [8], and Liu et al. [9], constitute representative examples of this methodology carried over in its full generality to the non-linear regime. The books by, for example, Bathe [10], Hughes [11], and Cris"eld [12], o!er comprehensive overviews of the degenerated solids approach and related methodologies which involve some type of reduction to a resultant formulation. Numerous modi"cations and generalizations of the degenerated shell approach can be seen in References [13}112].

3. RESULTANT-BASED FORMULATIONS There is an alternate point of view stating that thin bodies are best treated by replacing the general set of three-dimensional governing equations by a set of, in some sense, equivalent equations leading to the construction of shell theories. Such theories enable an insight into the structure of the equations involved independently, and prior to the computation itself. Based on them, powerful "nite elements may be formulated. One of the "rst achievements in this direction was due to Argyris and co-workers [113}116] in the development of the SHEBA family of "nite elements and, thereafter, their generalizations [117}121]. Eriksen and Truesdell [122] initiated the direct approach to the construction of shell theories by considering the shell as a surface with oriented directors. They were inspired by the concept of a Cosserats [123] continuum by which, in addition to the displacement "eld and independent of it, rotational degrees of freedom are assigned to every particle of the continuum. The resulting equations and strain measure chosen were quite di!erent from those proposed originally by Cosserats [123]. The strain measures suggested in their studies were essentially based on the di!erence of metrics. As far as the one-director formulation is concerned, it is equivalent to, and in fact can be derived as the Green strain tensor of the three-dimensional theory of elasticity, if the displacement "eld is assumed to vary linearly over the shell thickness. Working along similar lines, Simo et al. [124}130] proposed a stress-resultant-based geometrically exact shell model which is formulated entirely in stress resultants and is essentially equivalent to a one director inextensible Cosserat surface. The work by the research group of Simo, in fact, represents a return to the origins of classical non-linear shell theory which, as mentioned, has its modern point of departure from the original work of the Cosserats [123], subsequently treated by Eriksen and Turesdell [122], and further elaborated upon by a number of authors; notably Green and Laws [131], Green and Zerna [132], and Cohen and DeSilva [133]. Over the years, numerous papers have appeared in the literature that have provided sophistication and generalization of these ideas. A list of the related notable works can be seen in References [134}149].

4. REDUCED INTEGRATION WITH STABILIZATION (HOURGLASS CONTROL) Applications of "nite element methods to problems related to industrial applications, together with the developments of numerical algorithms for non-linear and transient analysis, attracted "nite element researchers to develop elements that were simple and e$cient. This driving force led to the emergence of a series of elements that used lower-order polynomial expressions, primarily for simplicity in mesh generation, and also for robustness in complicated non-linear problems with multiple contacting surfaces. These elements used the concept of reduced and selective reduced integration techniques for computational e$ciency. It was noted early on that in nonlinear and transient problems, a plate element that requires only a single quadrature point is particularly desirable since the evaluation of the constitutive equation and element kinematics consume a large share of the computer time. A vast portion of the literature has been devoted to this topic from which we cite some of the most prominent ones. The development started with a pure application of reduced integration techniques. A quadrilateral element with bilinear de#ection and rotation "elds based on Mindlin plate theory with a single quadrature point was introduced by Hughes et al. [150] under the name U1. However, the element U1 turned out to be

rank de"cient: the rank of the sti!ness was less than its total number of degrees of freedom minus the rigid-body modes. For some meshes and boundary conditions this rank de"ciency resulted in singularity or near singularity of the assembled sti!ness matrix, which manifested itself in solutions with severe spatial oscillations, often called the hourglass patterns. Later Hughes and Tezduyar [151], using a scheme motivated by the work of MacNeal [152], corrected the rank de"ciency by using 2;2 quadrature and re"ned the interpolation of the transverse shear so that locking could be avoided. However, these schemes resulted in the loss of an attractive potential of the bilinear element, namely, the use of one-point quadrature. Another approach to this element was taken by Taylor [153], who explored the use of Koslo! and Frazier's [154] hourglass control scheme. In a contemporary development, a four-node quadrilateral shell element with one quadrature point in the midsurface was described by Belytschko and Tsay [155]. This element was adopted in DYNA3D, PAMCRASH and other commercial programs developed for crashworthiness studies. The major objective in the development of the Belytschko}Tsay [155] element was to attain a convergent, stable element with the minimum number of computations. For this reason, the element employed bilinear isoparametrics with one quadrature point in the midplane when the material was elastic. For non-linear materials, several quadrature points were used through the thickness at a single midplane point. Since this element with one-point quadrature would be rank de"cient, an hourglass control was added. Because of the emphasis on speed, several shortcuts were made in formulating the element equations. On the whole, the element has performed quite well, but it has two shortcomings: (i) it performs poorly when warped and, in particular, it does not correctly solve the twisted beam problem, and (ii) it does not pass the quadratic Kirchho!-type patch test in the thin plate limit. The latter shortcoming is shared by Hughes}Liu [4] element and its importance was not realized until recently. A uniform strain hexahedron and quadrilateral with orthogonal hourglass control was developed by Flanagan and Belytschko [156]. They also proposed a treatment of zero-energy modes which arise due to one-point integration of "rst-order isoparametric "nite element. In their work, they studied two hourglass control schemes, namely (i) viscous and (ii) elastic. In addition, they also proposed a convenient one-point integration scheme which analytically integrated the element volume and uniform strain modes. However, the use of one-point quadrature schemes for both the volumetric and deviatoric stresses resulted in certain deformation modes remaining stressless. The reason lies in that if a mesh is consistent with a global pattern of these (and perhaps rigid body) modes, they quickly dominate and destroy the solution. These modes are called kinematic, or zero energy modes in the "nite element literature, and hourglass modes for hexahedrons and quadrilaterals in the "nite di!erence literature. Belytschko and Tsai [155] had proposed a stabilization procedure for controlling the kinematic modes of the four-node, bilinear quadrilateral element when single-point quadrature was used. These kinematics modes manifested themselves by spatial oscillations or singularity of the total sti!ness. In their stabilization procedure, additional generalized strains were de"ned which were activated by the kinematic modes. However, these generalized modes were not activated by rigid-body motion regardless of the shape of the quadrilateral. By using a scaling law the stabilization parameters were de"ned so that they did not adversely a!ect the element's performance. In a contemporary development, this de"ciency was eradicated in a series of papers by Belytschko and co-workers [157}161]. Working along similar lines, Liu and co-workers [162}165] showed that the stabilization vectors could, in fact, be obtained naturally by taking partial derivatives with respect to the natural co-ordinates. Their objective was to control the hourglass mode in the underintegrated "nite elements, to increase the computational e$ciency without adverse e!ects on accuracy, and

to demonstrate that the resulting continuum element did not experience any locking phenomenon when the material became incompressible. In comparison with the hourglasscontrolled "nite elements developed by Belytschko and co-workers [155, 156], this element did not require any stabilization parameters or numerical integrations. Stabilization of the underintegrated elements continued to be of considerable importance and led various researchers to develop stabilization schemes based on the assumed strain method. Belytschko et al. [158] developed a projection operator, orthogonal to constant strain "elds on an eight-node hexahedral element with uniform reduced integration. It was shown that the stabilization forces depended only on the element geometry and material properties. The assumed strain "eld was also used with four-point integration which did not require stabilization. In addition, two forms of the B-matrix were studied and it was shown that the mean form is more e$cient since it passed the patch test in a simpli"ed form. Despite its considerable success, the problem with the assumed strain approach remains that these elements sometime show strange modes in rather simple engineering problems. Some other researchers who worked along similar lines are listed in References [166}174].

5. INCOMPATIBLE MODES APPROACH Numerous applications involve deformations which are associated with large strains. Furthermore, problems undergoing large elastic strains are often constrained by the incompressibility of the material, as is the case for rubber. Due to their simple geometry, four-node quadrilateral elements are widely used in such applications. It is well known that the presence of incompressibility leads to the so-called &locking' phenomenon in case of a discretization with standard displacement elements. Several methods to circumvent this problem have been developed. Amongst these are the reduced integration techniques or the mixed methods. In some approaches rank de"ciency of underintegrated elements, which then leads to hourglassing, is bypassed by stabilization techniques. Lately, Simo and Rifai [175] in the linear case or Simo et al. [176] in the non-linear case have developed a family of elements which are based on the Hu}Washizu variational principle. These elements are extensions of the incompatible QM6 element developed by Taylor et al. [177]. They do not seem to have any rank de"ciency and perform well in bending situations as well as in the case of incompressibility. For geometrically non-linear analysis, Hueck and Wriggers [178}179] proposed a similar incompatible quadrilateral element that utilizes a second-order Taylor series expansion of element basis functions in the physical co-ordinates. The element is designated QS6. Later, Wrigger et al. [186] proposed a formulation of the QS6 element for large elastic deformations. In their work, the basic Hu}Washizu principle is utilized to derive the underlying equations for the element construction. Working on the stabilization of the rectangular four-node quadrilateral element, Hueck et al. [178], developed the standard bilinear displacement "eld of the plane linear elastic rectangular four-node quadrilateral element, enhanced by incompatible modes. The resulting gradient operators were separated into constant and linear parts corresponding to underintegration and stabilization of the element sti!ness matrix. Minimization of potential energy was used to generate exact analytical expressions for the hourglass stabilization of the rectangle. The stabilized element was shown to coincide with the element obtained by the mixed assumed strain method. In a further generalization by Hueck et al. [179], the expressions for gradient operators were obtained from an expansion of the basis functions into a second-order Taylor series in the

physical co-ordinates. The internal degrees of freedom of the incompatible modes were eliminated on the element level. A modi"ed change of variables was used to integrate the element matrices. The formulation included the cases of plane stress and plane strain as well as the analysis of incompressible materials. Some of the related works can be found in References [181}186]. Analysis of three-dimensional non-linear problems is certainly within the reach of the computational resources of today. Nevertheless, for rational use of the available computational power, the choice of element is a very important factor. In the non-linear Lagrangian computations one would typically opt for solid elements with low-order interpolations: "rstly, because they have a more robust performance in the distorted con"gurations, and secondly, because these elements facilitate more convenient manipulations in the adaptive h-type of mesh re"nement. However, it is well known that the standard trilinear brick elements exhibit rather poor performance unless additional arti"ces are used. The method of incompatible modes had been introduced by Wilson et al. [187] as an approach for improving the behaviour of low-order elements in bending-dominated deformation patterns. The practical features of the method include higher-order accuracy for a coarse mesh, mesh distortion insensitivity and excellent performance in the analysis of nearly incompressible and non-linear materials. However, the de"ciencies of the initial formulation of Wilson's elements when they assume the distorted con"guration, led the researchers to ignore even the desirable features of the method of incompatible modes and not follow the approach. Taylor et al. [177] corrected the particular form of initial formulation by enforcing the patch test satisfaction. However, the method still did not receive wide acceptance. Instead, hybrid formulations which considered the stresses and displacements as independent variables were developed as a successful alternative. Ibrahimbegovic and Wilson [180] and Ibrahimbegovic and Kozar [181] presented a geometrically non-linear version of the well-known eight-node Wilson brick element. The element was based on variational formulation and was modi"ed via the method of incompatible modes. It was shown that the incompatible modes formulation exhibited essentially the same performance as the hybrid methods. It is important to note that the displacement-based incompatible modes formulation possesses de"nite advantages when it comes to non-linear constitutive material models. For example, many rate forms of constitutive equations are naturally integrated with the displacement-driven algorithm, e.g. return mapping algorithm for J2 plasticity, or constitutive equations directly given in the strain space. The method of incompatible modes has recently been re-examined within the framework of the three-"eld Hu}Washizu variational principle. In the work of Simo et al. [176], the original incompatible mode concept is abandoned, and the enhanced strain "eld is constructed directly instead. In addition to the displacement and strain "elds the stress "eld is also constructed as an orthogonal complement to the enhanced strain "eld, so that it does not appear in the "nal form of the variational statement.

6. ENHANCED STRAIN APPROACH Enhanced strain elements have also been an area of active interest. Since these elements perform very well in the incompressible limit as well as in bending situations, they have been applied to simulate geometrically and materially non-linear problems. Several enhanced strain elements have been developed over the last years [188}222]. These elements provide a robust tool for numerical simulations in solid mechanics. Due to the construction of the elements with enhanced

strains, these element formulations show a very good coarse mesh accuracy. Furthermore, the implementation of inelastic material models is straightforward. Following the work of Simo and Rifai [175], serveral other authors have also developed similar element formulations for small strain applications.

7. ENHANCED STRAIN METHOD FOR 3-D TYPE ELEMENTS The search for 3-D type elements which provide a general tool for solving arbitrary problems in solid mechanics has a long history. This can be seen from the large number of papers which have been published on the subject. The main goal is to "nd a general element formulation which ful"lls the following requirements: (i) no locking for incompressible materials, (ii) good bending behaviour, (iii) no locking in the limit of very thin elements, (iv) distortion insensitivity, (v) good coarse mesh accuracy, (vi) simple implementation of non-linear constitutive laws, and (vii) e$ciency. These requirements have di!erent origins. The "rst two result from the necessity to obtain acceptable answers for the mentioned problems, especially the "rst point is essential for the analysis of rubber-like materials or for classical J -elastoplasticity problems. The third point becomes â¬ increasingly important since it enables the user of such elements to simulate shell problems by three-dimensional elements, which is simpler for complicated structures. This spares the need for introducing "nite rotations as variables in thin shell problems, results in simpler contact detection on upper and lower surfaces and provides the possibility to apply three-dimensional constitutive equations straight away. The fourth point is essential since modern mesh generation tools yield, for arbitrary geometries, unstructured meshes which always include distorted elements. Also, elements get highly distorted during non-linear simulations including "nite deformations. The "fth point results from the fact that many engineering problems have to be modelled as three-dimensional problems. Due to computer limitations, quite coarse meshes have to be used often to solve these problems. Thus, an element which provides a good coarse mesh accuracy is valuable in these situations. Point six is associated with the fact that more and more non-linear computations involving non-linear constitutive models have to be performed to design engineering structures. Thus, an element formulation which allows a straightforward implementation of such constitutive equations is desirable. Lastly, the e$ciency of the element formulation is of great importance when "nite element meshes with several hundred thousands of elements have to be used to solve complex engineering problems. To construct elements that ful"l most of these requirements, and possibly all of them, di!erent approaches have been followed throughout the last decade and a half. Among these are: (i) techniques of underintegration, (ii) stabilization methods, (iii) hybrid or mixed variational principles for stresses and displacements, involving the use of complementary energy, (iv) mixed Hu}Washizu variational principles, (v) mixed variational principles for rotation "elds, and (vi) mixed variational principles for selected quantities. References 223}243 provide a detailed exposition of the various approaches outlined above.

8. DRILLING DEGREES OF FREEDOM ELEMENTS In recent years there has been a revival of interest in elements possessing in-plane rotational degrees of freedom (also called drilling degrees of freedom). Membrane elements of this kind possess practical advantages in the analysis of shell structures and folded plates. For example,

combining a plate bending element with a membrane element possessing drilling rotations forms a shell element in which each node has six degrees-of-freedom, three displacements and three rotations. Typical membrane "nite elements do not possess the in-plane rotational degree of freedom, and so when combined with a plate element, they form a shell element with only "ve degrees-of-freedom per node. Although it is possible to work in a locally de"ned "ve-degree-offreedom system at each node, numerous practical di$culties in programming and model construction must be overcome. Membrane "nite elements with drilling degrees of freedom circumvent these problems [246, 247]. Thus, the presence of the sixth nodal degree of freedom is very appealing from an engineering point of view. Numerous works have appeared in the engineering literature in the last decade in which successful approaches towards incorporating drilling rotations in membrane elements have been described [248}284]. It is interesting to note that most of the elements proposed involve a variety of special devices. The simplest and most commonly used remedy is the addition of a "ctitious torsional-spring sti!ness at each node. This, however, renders the numerical method inconsistent, possibly degrading its convergence properties. There have also been developments in the mathematics literature, where variational formulations that employ independent rotation "elds have been studied [244]. Ideas of this kind go back to Reissner [268]. Hughes and Brezzi [244], and Hughes et al. [245}247] endeavored to pursue this subject mathematically, with an aim at developing a theoretically sound and, at the same time, practically useful formulation for engineering applications. A number of variational formulations for linear elastostatics with independent rotation "elds were analysed and it was observed that numerical methods based on the conventional formulations are unstable when convenient interpolations are employed. Consequently, several formulations based on modi"cations of the classical variational framework were proposed and were shown to be convergent for all combinations of displacement/rotation interpolations. In particular, a displacement-type modi"ed variational formulation was developed, and numerical assessments of membrane elements emanating from this theory were presented in Hughes et al. [245, 246]. In a subsequent work, Hughes et al. [247] presented variational formulations for elastodynamics and for the corresponding timeharmonic problem. The issue of zero masses associated with the rotational degrees of freedom was addressed and a novel method for consistently introducing rotational masses was introduced. Working along similar lines, in a series of papers, Ibrahimbegovic et al. [272}274] presented drilling rotations in a stress-resultant-based geometrically non-linear shell model which had features in common with the approach proposed in Simo et al. [270].

9. COROTATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR SHELL ANALYSIS The requirement for more optimally designed structures in aerospace and other applications demands that complex shell structures be analysed well into the non-linear regime. This, in turn, has motivated researchers to develop a number of improvements that permit the accurate modelling of shells undergoing large rotations, e.g. during large de#ections or postbuckling. Traditionally, the implementation of most large rotation "nite element formulations has been carried out in a single module where the constitutive law and the element kimematic descriptions are tightly coupled. This approach renders many existing beam and shell "nite elements, based on moderate rotation assumptions, ine!ective for large rotation problems. Moreover, there is no general consensus as to which of these newly developed formulations is preferable, and often the analysts resist parting with the reliable, yet more restrictive elements they have experience with.

Hence, development of a more generic, element-independent approach to large rotations became a topic of intense investigation. Belytschko and Hsieh [285] proposed a method based on convected co-ordinates to develop a small strain, large rotation beam element. The use of convected co-ordinates, in e!ect, decomposes the motion into its deformational part and rigidbody component. Later, a procedure was developed that uses the above decomposition in a co-rotational co-ordinate frame to compute strains from arbitrarily large displacements and rotations for any element. This approach may be used to construct a procedure that extracts, from a given displacement "eld, the pure deformations, i.e. displacement components that are free of any rigid-body motion. An advantage of this procedure is that it can be implemented independently of the element formulation. Thus, a set of algebraic operations can be described, and software utilities developed, which extend any implementation of a small displacement/rotation element formulation to that of a large displacement/rotation one. These operations involve, in particular, a projection matrix that has a number of interesting properties. First, it converts a non-equilibrating force vector associated with an element into a self-equilibrating one when multiplied with the transpose of the projection matrix. Second, the rigid-body components of an incremental displacement vector are eliminated when multiplied by the projector (large rigid-body rotation components are removed by a related projection matrix). Finally, it transforms an element sti!ness matrix to one with correct rigid-body properties. If the sti!ness matrix already has the correct zero-energy modes, this transformation will have no e!ect on the sti!ness matrix. In other words, the element is forced to have the correct invariance properties under rigid-body motion. These properties of the projection matrix can be used to extend the application range of many existing beam, plate and shell elements to account for large displacement behaviour. Following the work of Belytschko, Liu et al. [286, 287] developed multiple quadrature underintegrated elements. Working along the lines of co-rotational framework, Moita and Cris"eld [288] developed enhanced lower-order element formulations for large strains where they showed that a more general procedure could be devised with the aid of mixed assumed strain procedures. A mathematical decomposition of motion into rotation and stretch was provided by Qin et al. [289]. In a subsequent work, Peng and Cris"eld [290] described an alternate approach that involves a form of co-rotational technique. In a continuum context the co-rotational technique has very close links with Biot-stress formulation. In their work they showed that once the co-rotational technique is extended to large-strain plasticity, there are some advantages in considering the co-rotational framework. A co-rotational, updated Lagrangian formulation for geometrically non-linear analysis of shells is proposed by Jiang and Chernuka [291, 292]. In their "nite element procedure, a standard updated Lagrangian formulation is employed to generate the tangent sti!ness matrix, and a co-rotational theory is used for updating element strain, stress and internal force vectors during the Newton}Raphson iterations. In a subsequent work, Wriggers and Gruttmann [293] and Gruttman et al. [294] developed thin shell formulation with "nite rotations based on the concept of Biot stress. A set of examples using co-rotational procedure has been given in Jiang et al. [292].

10. COMPOSITE SHELL FINITE ELEMENTS Plate and shell structures made of laminated composite materials have often been modelled as an equivalent single layer using classical laminate theory (CLT), see for example the text by

Jones [295], in which the thickness stress components are ignored. Note that the CLT is a direct extension of the classical plate theory in which the well-known Kirchho!}Love kinematic hypothesis is enforced, i.e. plane sections remain plane and that a normal to the midplane before deformation remains straight and normal to the midplane after deformation. This theory is adequate when the ratio of the thickness to length (or other dimension) is small. However, laminated plates and shells made of advanced "lamentary composite materials are susceptible to thickness e!ects because their e!ective transverse modulii are signi"cantly small as compared to the e!ective elastic modulus along the "bre direction. Reddy and Kuppusamy [296] have shown that the natural frequencies predicted by the CLT may be as much as 25 per cent higher than those predicted by including the shear e!ects for a plate with side to thickness ratio of 10. Furthermore, the classical theory of plates under-predicts de#ections and overpredicts natural frequencies and buckling loads. In order to overcome the de"ciencies in the CLT, re"ned laminate theories have been proposed. A review of these theories along with the respective kinematic relations used in these theories is available in Reference [297]. These are single-layer theories in which the transverse shear stresses are taken into account. They provide improved global response estimates for de#ections, vibration frequencies and buckling loads of moderately thick composites when compared to the CLT. A Mindlin-type "rst-order transverse shear deformation theory (FSDT) was "rst developed by Whitney and Pagano [298] for multi-layered anisotropic plates, and by Dong et al. [299], and Dong and Tso [300] for multi-layered anisotropic shells. A description of other available theories can be found, for example, in the review article by Kapania [301]. Both approaches (CLT and FSDT) consider all layers as one equivalent single anisotropic layer, thus they cannot model the warping of cross-sections. Furthermore, the assumption of a nondeformable normal results in incompatible shearing stresses between adjacent layers. The latter approach, because it assumes constant transverse shear stress, also requires the introduction of an arbitrary shear correction factor which depends on the lamination parameters for obtaining accurate results. It is well established that such a theory is adequate to predict only the gross behaviour of laminates. A higher-order theory overcoming some of these limitations was presented by Reddy [302] for laminated plates and by Reddy and Liu [303] for laminated shells. Note that, because of the material mismatch at the intersection of the layers, the single-layer theories lead to transverse shear and normal stress mismatch at the intersection. This renders these theories inadequate for detailed, accurate local stress analysis. The exact analyses performed by Pagano [304] on the composite #at plates have indicated that the in-plane distortion of the deformed normal depends not only on the laminate thickness, but also on the orientation and the degree of orthotropy of the individual layers. Therefore, the hypothesis of non-deformable normals, while acceptable for isotropic plates and shells, is often quite unacceptable for multi-layered anisotropic plates and shells that have a large ratio of Young's modulus to shear modulus, even if they are relatively thin. Thus, a transverse shear deformation theory which also accounts for the warping of the deformed normal is required for accurate prediction of the elastic behaviour (de#ections, thickness distribution of the in-plane displacements, natural frequencies, etc.) of multi-layered anisotropic plates and shells. In view of these issues, a variationally sound theory that accounts for the 3-D e!ects, allows thickness variation, and permits the warping of the deformed normal, is required for a re"ned analysis of thick and thin composites. A signi"cant contribution in this direction was presented by Masud et al. [27]. A number of theories are available that can, short of a full-#edged threedimensional analysis of plates and shells, accurately and e$ciently predict the stress distribution

including the zig-zag variation of the inplane displacement components in the thickness direction. Two classes of theories are available: layerwise theories and the individual layer plate theory. In the layerwise plate theory, suggested by Reddy [305], the continuity of the transverse normal and shear stresses is not enforced. In the individual-layer plate models, see for example, [306}308], the transverse shear stress continuity is enforced a priori. A recent review of the various available theories is given in [309]. For geometrically nonlinear theory, the reader is referred to the work by Librescu [310]. As is the case for isotropic shells, all types of shell elements have been used for the linear and non-linear analysis of laminated shells. A review of earlier developments (1976}1988) in the "nite element analysis of laminated shells is given by Kapania [301]. Various theories have been used for the development of "nite elements. Using CLT, the present authors [311] developed a 48 degrees-of-freedom "nite element to study geometrically non-linear response of imperfect laminated plates and shells. This element was successfully used by Byun and Kapania [312] to study the impact response of imperfect laminated plates in conjunction with a reduced-basis approach [313]. A post-processor for this element that can accurately predict the interlaminar stresses, by integrating the equilibrium equations of a laminated plate, was developed by Byun and Kapania [314]. In a subsequent study, Kapania and Stoumbos [315] performed impact response of laminated shells. The afore-mentioned element was derived using the tensor notation and a shell theory. There still exists a considerable interest, mainly due to the simplicity of their formulation, in using a large number of #at elements [316] to model curved shells. The #at &shell' element is obtained by combining a plate element with a membrane element. Often, the "nite element designers use either the constant strain triangular (CST) or the linear strain triangular (LST) element to represent the membrane behaviour. As a result, the element lacks inplane rotational degree of freedom. This leads to a singular sti!ness matrix when all elements with a common node are coplanar and the local co-ordinate system coincides with the global co-ordinate system. A number of approaches have been suggested to avoid this singularity without overly constraining the element. Zienkiewicz [317], for example, suggests the use of an arbitrary value of the rotational sti!ness at that node. The approach is based on determining a unique normal at each node and ensuring that the attached elements produce no moments about it [318]. The original approach was found to give erroneous results in the case of, for example the linear analysis of a hook problem, termed the Raasch Challenge [319] problem. This approach was subsequently modi"ed [318] and has been implemented in the commercial "nite element program NASTRAN. Another approach, an obvious one, is to employ an element that has in-plane rotational degree of freedom. Allman [320] suggested a membrane triangular element that has three degrees-offreedom, two translations and a rotation, at each node. Ertas et al. [321] presented a three-node triangular element, termed AT/DKT, by combining an element similar to the Allman membrane triangular element with the discrete Kirchho! theory (DKT) for formulating the plate bending element to study laminated plates. The membrane element was obtained from the linear strain element using a transformation suggested by Cook [253] and the formulation of the DKT element is available in [321]. A computer program for this formulation was given by Jeyachandrabose and Kirkhoppe [323]. Ertas et al. [321] compared their results for a cantilever #at plate with those given by STRI3, a three-node triangular faceted element in the commercial available "nite element program ABAQUS. Kapania and Mohan [324] tested the #at element developed by Ertas et al. [321] for static and dynamic response analyses of laminated shells to study its accuracy and convergence characteristics. They also extended the element to analyse shells

subjected to thermal loads. Since the DKT formulation suggested by Batoz et al. [322] does not employ explicit interpolation functions for the transverse displacements, the determination of consistent mass is not straightforward. The mass matrix in the formulation of Kapania and Mohan was determined using the cubic polynomial suggested by Specht [325] and the response of laminated structures under both thermal and other induced strains was studied. The element was employed for static analysis, free vibration analysis, and thermal deformation analysis. A numerical example, previously solved by Jonalgadda [326], was also presented to study the response of a symmetrically laminated graphite/epoxy laminate excited by a layer of piezoelectric material. The results in all cases were found to be in excellent agreement with those obtained by using other "nite elements or the Ritz method. The element was used by Kapania and Lovejoy [327] to study the free vibration of point-supported skew plates, and by Kapania et al. [328] to study the control of thermal deformation of a spherical mirror segment to be used in nextgeneration Hubble-type telescope. The ability of the DKT/AT to model the inplane rotation makes this element quite suitable to study large displacement analysis of laminated shells. Mohan and Kapania [329] extended the DKT /AT element to study such behaviour using an updated Lagrangian approach. Results were presented for large-rotation static response, non-linear dynamic response, and thermal postbuckling analyses. The results obtained from the DKT/AT were found to be in excellent agreement with those available in literature and/or those given by the commercial "nite element code ABAQUS. The element consistently performed better than STRI3, a combination of DKT and CST. Including the inplane rotational sti!ness is, thus, important for large displacement analysis. It is noted that Argyris and Tenek [118, 119, 330] presented geometrically non-linear analysis of isotropic and composites plates and shells using the three-node #at shell element based on the natural-mode technique. Finite elements based on higher-order shear deformation theory have also been developed and employed. Engelstad et al. [331] have employed a nine-node quadrilateral shell element, developed by Chao and Reddy [332] to study the postbuckling and failure of graphite epoxy plates loaded in compression. Panels with holes were also studied and the results were compared with the experimental data. A progressive damage model was applied that was successful in predicting the experimentally observed failure of these panels. Geometrically non-linear response of sti!ened shells was performed by Liao and Reddy [333, 334]. A cylindrical shell "nite element using layerwise theory was developed by Gerhard et al. [335]. The element was employed to study buckling and "rst ply failure of geodesically sti!ened cylindrical shells using the Tsai}Wu failure criterion. The sti!eners were modelled using a layerwise beam "nite element allowing their sti!ness to be directly assembled with that of the shell element. It is noted that the "nite elements developed using layerwise theory can provide more accurate results, but at a price. The number of unknowns increase as the number of layers increase. This may make the use of such elements impractical, especially at the design stage. Individual layer theories, in which the continuity of the transverse stresses is enforced a priori, provide accurate stresses but without the drawbacks of the layerwise theory. Icardi [336], employing the thirdorder zig-zag theory of Di Sciuva and Icardi [337], developed an eight-node, 56 degrees-offreedom, curvilinear plate "nite element. The nodal variables were: membrane displacement, transverse shear rotations, de#ections, slopes and curvatures for corner nodes, membrane displacements and transverse shear rotations for mid-side nodes. The element was able to accurately predict the transverse shear stresses using constitutive models. Cho [338] has

developed a 40 degrees-of-freedom, eight-node "nite element using the zig-zag theory to study static and dynamic response of plates. To the best of our knowledge, the elements based on individual layer theories have not yet been extended to shells, although it should be straightforward to use these elements to analyse shells due to the presence of the membrane degrees of freedom. Often, in the analysis of composite panels, the three-dimensional e!ects are important in certain localized areas, such as those near a free edge. A local/global analysis provides a means to reduce the CPU time and the storage requirements by using a global method, based on a plate/shell theory to, determine the overall response and by modelling the region with noticeable three-dimensional e!ects using 3-D "nite elements. Such an approach was successfully used by Kapania et al. [339] for composite plates with cut-outs and by Haryadi et al. [340] for composite plates with cracks. For modelling "bre-reinforced polymer-matrix composites, it is important to include the viscoelastic behaviour of the polymer matrix. Hammerand and Kapania [341] extended the capability of the AT/DKT [321, 324] element to perform viscoelastic analysis of composite plates and shells. The viscoelastic properties are represented using Prony series. There is, presently, a considerable interest in modelling plates and shells that have piezoelectric layers, either embedded or on top or bottom of laminated composites. These piezoelectric layers act as both sensors as well as actuators [342]. For the most part, the "nite element method is used to analyse these structures. Wang and Rogers [343] presented a laminate plate theory for spatially distributed induced strain actuators. Sophisticated "nite elements are being developed to analyse piezoelectric plates and shells. It is noted that, for these structures, the constitutive relations relate stresses to strains and the so-called electric displacements, and the electric "eld is related to the strain as well as the electric "eld. As a result, both mechanical and electric quantities (electric potential) are used as nodal variables. Tzou and Ye [344] and Valey and Rao [345] have performed analysis of shells with piezoelectric layers. A recent review of application of the "nite element method to adaptive plate and shell structures is given by Sunar and Rao [346].

11. CONCLUDING REMARKS In this paper, recent (last 15 or so years) advances in the "nite element technology for shells have been presented. Some additional recent papers address one or more aspects of the "nite element development for shells, for example [347, 348]. Chapelle and Bathe [349] discuss theoretical considerations that must be addressed when developing shell "nite elements that can be used for both bending and membrane dominated behaviours. They also provided a list of test problems that are bending and membrane dominated, respectively. Bathe et al. [350], evaluate the MITC shell element for its performance in solving the test problems suggested by Chapelle and Bathe [349]. MacNeal [348], provides his perspective on the "nite element for shell analysis including some recent advances in the use of p-version "nite element method. Finally, it is noted that recent developments to analyse shells have also included both the boundary element methods and the element-free Galerkin methods. For the boundary element methods, the reader is referred to the recent work of Liu [351] and for the element-free Galerkin method to Krysl and Belytscko [352, 353].

DEDICATION*A SUMMARY OF PROFESSOR GALLAGHER'S WORKS ON SHELL FINITE ELEMENTS This paper is dedicated to the memory of Professor Richard H. Gallagher in celebration of his lifetime achievements as an engineer, professor, higher education leader, and also his technical contributions to the development of the "eld of "nite elements, from its infancy to maturity. As this is the journal issue dedicated to Professor Gallagher, there is no need in this particular paper to account for his lifetime achievements. Rather, we will limit to an account of his research contributions in shell "nite elements, which are pertinent to the subject of this survey paper. Among the present authors, Yang was Gallagher's "rst Ph.D. student. Saigal and Kapania were Yang's Ph.D. students. Among the 379 papers surveyed, many authors were Gallagher's former students and colleagues. During Gallagher's early career, he spent 12 years (1955}1967) working at Bell Aerosystems Company in Bu!alo, New York. During this period, his published works included the studies of low aspect ratio wings with the e!ects of aerodynamic heating, optimum analysis and design of integral fuselage propellant tanks, elastic characteristics of airframes, laboratory simulation of non-linear static aerothermoelastic behaviour, minimum weight design of framework structures, thermal stresses and buckling of sandwich panels, and some shell related works on elastic buckling of isotropic cylindrical shells [354] as well as sandwich cylindrical shells [355]. These works were done during the infancy period of the parallel developments of both electronic digital computers and "nite element methods. Most of this work was done by computational methods, which was creatively original at the time and which shaped the earliest form of "nite element methods. In a paper published in 1963, Gallagher and Padlog [356] introduced the concept of the formulation of incremental sti!ness matrix based on the minimum potential energy principle to treat buckling problems. In 1964, Gallagher [357] wrote one of the earliest textbooks on "nite elements, during a time when "nite element methods were neither widely accepted nor even widely known. In a report in 1966, Gallagher [358] was among the earliest researchers to develop a 24 degree of freedom, doubly curved, thin shell "nite element. In a paper in 1967, Gallagher et al. [359] used #at plate "nite elements to model thin spherical cap to predict the buckling load. The work in References [356}359] would appear rather primitive from the current point of view. They were, nonetheless, pioneering, original, and visionary during that period of time. In 1968, Gallagher and Yang [360] published the work on shell buckling using a 24 degree of freedom doubly curved thin shell "nite element developed earlier by Gallagher [358]. The incremental sti!ness matrix was formulated using the minimum potential energy theorem and retaining the second-order terms in the strain-displacement equations. In 1969, Gallagher [361] presented a comprehensive paper summarizing the developments of "nite element methods in the analysis of plates and shells. Later, Gallagher et al. [362] published the work on elastic buckling of thin shells and extended it to the regime after buckling by including geometric non-linearity. In the subsequent few years, Gallagher [363}366] and his students published a series of papers re"ning the formulations for curved shell "nite elements and also progressively developed the procedure to predict the buckling and postbuckling behaviours of plates and shells within the framework of "nite element methods. One notable application of these research works was the application to the buckling analysis of hyperbolic cooling towers [367]. During this period of their e!orts on the research of shell buckling analysis, Professor Gallagher and his students and

colleagues also explored the e!ect of pressure sti!ness on shell instability [368], and the unsymmetric eigenproblem of shell buckling under pressure load [369]. Gallagher and Murthy [370] also used discrete Kirchho! theory to formulate an anisotropic cylindrical shell "nite element. Parallel to the early research of linear and non-linear analysis of thin shells, which included the continuously re"ned formulations of four-node doubly curved shell element and continuously improved prediction procedures for pre- and post-buckling analysis, Gallagher and Thomas also developed a shell "nite element of triangular shape based on generalized potential energy [371, 372]. This triangular shell "nite element was successfully used in the instability analysis of torispherical pressure vessel heads [373]. Gallagher and Murthy also developed a triangular thin shell "nite element based on discrete Kirchho! theory and performed patch test veri"cations [374}376]. One of Gallagher's numerous contributions in the development of "nite element methods, in general, and the shell "nite elements in particular, was his education of hundreds (or perhaps indirectly thousands) of engineers through his regular classes, short courses, seminars, conference presentations, and research collaborations. In this regard, we would like to mention a few of his most notable books and education papers on shells. Gallagher's textbook [377] on the fundamentals of "nite elements has been translated into "ve languages, i.e. Japanese, German, French, Chinese, and Russian. The volume on thin shell and curved member "nite elements edited by Gallagher and Ashwell [378] has been a fundamental contribution to the subject. In this book, Gallagher contributed two chapters*Chapter 1 summarized the problems and progress in thin shell "nite element analysis and Chapter 9 formulated a triangular thin shell element based on generalized potential energy [372]. One of Gallagher's notable lecture papers on shell elements was given in Reference [379]. It is with great honor and deep appreciation, we dedicate this paper to the memory of Professor R. H. Gallagher.
