Refined triangular discrete Mindlin flat shell elements
G. Zengjie, C. Wanji

52 Abstract In this paper ﬂat shell elements are formed by the assemblage of discrete Mindlin plate elements RDKTM and either the constant strain membrane element CST or the Allman’s membrane element with drilling degrees of freedom LST. The element RDKTM is a robust Mindlin plate element, which can perform uniformly thick and thin plate bending analysis. It also passes the patch test for thin plate bending, and its convergence for very thin plates can be ensured theoretically. The singularity of the stiffness matrix and membrane locking are studied for the present elements. Numerical examples are presented to show that the present models indeed possess properties of simple formulations, high accuracy for thin and thick shells, and it is free from shear locking for thin plate/shell analysis. Keywords Mindlin plate theory, Shear locking, Drilling degrees of freedom, Displacement functions of a Timoshenko beam known that for Mindlin plates that only C0 continuity is required and that the difﬁculties of C1 continuity for thin plate elements can be avoided. Moreover both thin plate and thick plate analysis can be integrated in the element model. Initially, Mindlin plate elements use strain-displacement relations to obtain bending and transverse shear strain. In this case, bending energy is written in terms of nodal rotations only, whereas shear strain energy is given in terms of both nodal rotations and deﬂections. When the plate becomes thin, transverse shear effects are reduced and nodal deﬂections become associated only with the vanishing shear energy. This is a difﬁcult situation to uphold and shear locking is soon observed. In order to avoid this, reduced integration [1, 2] and selective integration [3, 4] technique are widely used. In the 3-noded triangular element, a single Gauss point integration is used for calculating the shear strain energy. However, it is found that such elements have low accuracy, and furthermore, they very often cannot pass the patch test for thin plates. In the re-constituting shear strain technique, the shear-strain approximation along with the edgeprojection (or discrete Mindlin technique) has been used to derive 3-noded triangular Mindlin plate elements. A number of efﬁcient 9-DOF triangular Mindlin plate elements based on the discrete constraint and the equilibrium conditions can be produced [5–7]. These elements can converge towards the discrete Kirchhoff plate bending elements when the plate thickness is very small. Recently, a reﬁned nonconforming element method has been developed by Chen and Cheung. Based on the Mindlin plate theory, a new triangular plate element, RDKTM, with the re-constitution of the shear strain has been established [8, 9]. Using this method and the displacement function of the Timoshenko’s beam, formulation of new triangular thin/thick plate elements can be derived. It can be shown that the element RDKTM indeed possesses properties of high accuracy for thin and thick plates, is capable of passing the patch test required for Kirchhoff thin plate elements, and does not exhibit extra zero energy modes. In addition, RDKTM is free of locking for very thin plate analysis (where the thickness/span ratio is less than 10À30 ) and its convergence can be ensured theoretically. It is well known that when all elements connected to a node are coplanar, zero stiffness appears in the direction normal to the plane rotation (hz ), This causes the assembly stiffness matrix at a global level to be singular [10]. In order to avoid this singularity, Zienkiewicz [10] has suggested the addition of an 3 Â 3 artiﬁcial rotational stiffness matrix to all elements in the assembly. This matrix also

1 Introduction In the formulations of shell elements there are three distinct choices: (1) The ﬂat shell element, that is obtained by combining a membrane element for plane elasticity and a bending element for ﬂat plates; (2) The curved shell element, that is formulated according to shell theory; and (3) The degenerated shell element, that is formed based on the three dimensional solid theory. Among those formulations, the ﬂat shell element is considered simplest and avoids complex shell equations. Therefore, the application of ﬂat shell elements is widespread in engineering. Triangular ﬂat shell elements may be used to represent an arbitrarily shaped shell as a faceted surface for curved shell structures. In this case, convergence to the exact geometry is obtained when the mesh is reﬁned. Usually, triangular ﬂat shell elements consist of triangular constant strain membrane elements and triangular bending plate elements. To study this type of shell element, the ﬁrst step is the choice of an applicable plate element and an applicable membrane element. However, shear locking has been a major problem for the Mindlin plate element. It is well

appears in a more recent formulation [11]. This problem may be avoided by using rotational ﬁctitious stiffness or by introducing drilling degrees of freedom in the formulation of the membrane element. Earlier attempts to develop membrane elements with drilling degrees of freedom were not successful [12]. An important advance was made by Allman [13] who proposed a 9-DOF compatible triangular element with quadratic varying displacement ﬁelds. This element is known to have a spurious zero energy mode, while its vertex rotations are not true rotations in the sense of plane elasticity. Another problem with this method is that triangular elements with drilling degrees of freedom encounter poor response for membrane action [14–16], especially in spherical shells and twisted beam structures [17]. Recently, an approach for adding true drilling rotations to the triangular thin ﬂat shell element was studied by Provias and Kattis [18]. Triangular, discrete Reissner-Mindlin plate and shell elements were studied by Sydenstricker and Landau [19], however the spherical shell and twisted beam problem are not considered. In this paper, reﬁned 15/18-DOF triangular discrete Mindlin ﬂat shell elements are formed by the assembly of triangular discrete Mindlin plate elements, RDKTM, and triangular constant strain membrane elements, CST/Allman’s triangular membrane element with drilling rotations LST.

It should be noted that according to the Timoshenko beam function, the shear strain cs on the element boundary is constant and can be denoted as cs4 ; cs5 and cs6 , therefore cxi and cyi can be denoted at the mi-side node i. The element shear strains, cx and cy can be found by using cs4 , cs5 and cs6 . The resulting shear strains cx and cy of the element are linearly distributed as their presumed values are distributed linearly. The patch test is presented to indicate that cx and cy can exactly express zero constant shear strain, and are free of shear locking. The shear part of the stiffness matrix of the element RDKTM can be written as follows,

element. This results in the thin and thick shell analysis being integrated in a uniform model and the convergence for very thin plate can be ensured theoretically. Second, the proposed discrete Mindlin ﬂat shell element is a re-constitution shear strain element, which possesses high accuracy and has the ability for passing the patch test for Kirchhoff thin plate bending. It is also free from shear locking, and the Kirchhoff thin plate results can be obtained even for very thin plates with thickness/span ratios of 10À30 . This can be considered as the most efﬁcient and simplest model among the existing ones. Third, In order to efﬁciently suppress singularities of the structural stiffness matrix, it is necessary to introduce true drilling rotations. Numerical examples are presented to show that the proposed element RDKTM18 (T) possesses high accuracy, especially for spherical shells and twisted beam structures. Finally, the formulations of the proposed elements RDKTM15 and RDKTM18 (T) are simple, and these elements can be used to solve thick/ thin shell problems.
