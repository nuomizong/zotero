In this paper, we present an effective new 3-node triangular shell ﬁnite element, called the MITC3+ element. The new shell element is based on the concepts earlier published for the MITC3 shell element (Lee and Bathe, 2004) [1] but is enriched by a cubic bubble function for the rotations. A new assumed transverse shear strain ﬁeld is developed for the element. The shell element passes the three basic tests (the isotropy, patch and zero energy mode tests) and shows excellent convergence behavior in basic and encompassing convergence tests.

1. Introduction During the last decades, the ﬁnite element method has been widely used for the analysis of shell structures. However, although a great effort has been expended to develop an effective 3-node shell ﬁnite element, no element is currently available that has been shown to be reliable and effective in the analysis of general shell structures [1–11]. Such element should show isotropic behavior and pass the consistency, ellipticity and inf–sup conditions and hence be optimal in convergence regardless of the shell geometry, thickness of the shell, boundary conditions and applied loading [2,3]. The highly sensitive and complex behavior of shell structures has made it extremely difﬁcult to establish such an element [3,12– 16]. Shell structures can exhibit membrane dominated, bending dominated and mixed behaviors, with high strain gradients in internal and boundary layers. An effective ﬁnite element formulation should be able to represent these behaviors and converge at optimal rate in an appropriate norm for any shell thickness. If a ﬁnite element discretization cannot accurately approximate the pure bending displacement ﬁelds of shells, the solution accuracy deteriorates in bending dominated and mixed shell behaviors. This phenomenon is called ‘‘locking’’ and can be severe when the shell thickness decreases [2,3,12]. To alleviate the locking behavior, while preserving the properties of consistency and ellipticity, the MITC method has been successfully used to establish quadrilateral and triangular shell elements [1,2,17–21]. However, while the

3-node triangular MITC3 element is useful, the element is not optimal in its convergence behaviors [1,11]. An important point is that to generate meshes for a triangular shell element is relatively easy, even for complex shell analyses. In addition, an effective 3-node shell element would be attractive due to the small bandwidth of the governing global stiffness and mass matrices. So far, 4-node quadrilateral shell elements, and notably the 4-node MITC4 element, have been dominantly used in practice due to their superior performance compared to triangular shell elements. However, these quadrilateral elements deteriorate in their convergence behaviors when the elements are geometrically distorted, see e.g. Ref. [22]. In general, 3-node triangular elements for the two-dimensional analysis of solids and the analysis of shells suffer from a lack of displacement modes [2,9,10]. To overcome this inherent limitation in some elements, a scheme to enrich the displacement ﬁeld can be effective [22–25]. In particular, bubble functions have been used to improve the predictive capability of ﬁnite elements for twoand three-dimensional solid and ﬂuid ﬂow analyses, and for plate and shell solutions [2,20,24,26–29]. A cubic bubble function for a 3-node triangular element is attractive [24,26] because it provides a higher-order interpolation inside the element while maintaining the linear interpolation along the element edges, thus providing compatibility between elements. In the development of the new triangular 3-node shell element, which we call the MITC3+ shell element, we use a cubic bubble function for the interpolation of the rotations to enrich the bending displacements. That is, only 2 internal rotation degrees of freedom are added to the standard 3-node shell element. Hence, the bubble function does not affect the mid-surface displacement of the shell

element, and the corresponding degrees of freedom can be statically condensed out on the element level. To reduce shear locking in the shell element, a new assumed transverse shear strain ﬁeld is designed. The MITC3+ shell element passes all basic tests, that is, the isotropy, zero energy mode and patch tests, and shows an excellent convergence behavior in the solution of plate and shell benchmark problems, even when severely distorted meshes are used. In the following sections, the formulation of the MITC3+ shell element is given and the performance of the element is presented. 2. Formulations of the triangular shell ﬁnite elements In this section, we brieﬂy recall the formulation of the MITC3 shell element and then present the formulation of the new MITC3+ shell element. 2.1.

Since the 3-node triangular shell ﬁnite element is ﬂat, the covariant in-plane strain components are calculated using Eqs. (1)–(3). However, the covariant transverse shear strain ﬁeld is established using the MITC scheme. The transverse shear strain ﬁeld of the MITC3 shell element is based on assuming constant covariant transverse shear strain conditions along the edges

in which a4 and b4 are the rotation degrees of freedom at the bubble node. The bubble node, with rotation degrees of freedom only, is positioned on the ﬂat surface deﬁned by the three corner nodes of the element. Only the bending and transverse shear strain ﬁelds are enriched by the bubble function, and the geometry of the element would remain ﬂat, as for the MITC3 element, if a large deformation analysis were pursued. Also, static condensation can be carried out on the element level for the rotations a4 and b4.

As for the MITC3 shell element, we only use the mixed interpolation for the transverse shear strain components, but we must design a new assumed transverse shear strain ﬁeld because the effect of the bubble function should be included. To design the new assumed transverse shear strain ﬁeld, we focus on two considerations. Firstly, the tying points for the covariant transverse shear strain components should be inside the element, that is, not on the element edges as for the MITC3 element, because the bubble function is zero along the element edges. Secondly, the stiffness of the in-plane twisting mode, see Fig. 4, must be reduced [10]. Considering a 3-node triangular shell element (that is, without the node for the bubble), the transverse shear strains occur in two transverse shearing modes and in an in-plane twisting mode. The in-plane twisting mode corresponds to twisting of the element about the axis normal to the mid-surface at the barycenter, r = s = 1/3, as shown in Fig. 4, with zero transverse shear strains at that point. The transverse shear strain ﬁeld of the MITC3 shell element can be separated into the constant part corresponding to the transverse shearing modes and the linear part corresponding to the in-plane twisting mode

tying positions (1)–(3). To include the effect of the bubble function in the constant part, we design a new tying scheme using element internal points. First, the three covariant transverse shear strains e1t, e2t and e3t are deﬁned in the directions of the internal lines from the barycenter to the corners as shown in Fig. 5(a). The following relations are obtained for the covariant transverse shear strain components, for 0 6 r, s 6 1,

We can easily obtain the constant part by evaluating the transverse shear strains at the barycenter

Using Eq. (12a), the transverse shear strain components are sampled at three internal tying points (A), (B) and (C) on the three internal lines, see Fig. 5(b) and Table 1

It is important to note that the tying points have been selected to obtain a spatially isotropic element.

Subtracting, for the MITC3 shell element, the constant part from the transverse shear strain ﬁeld in Eq. (5), we obtain the linearly varying part

At this point, it is interesting to consider a 3-node shell ﬁnite element in which the geometry and displacement interpolations in Eqs. (1) and (2) and the new assumed transverse shear strain ﬁeld in Eq. (17) are employed. We label the element as MITC3i and study its performance also in the following sections. 3. Basic numerical tests In this section, we consider the three basic tests: the isotropy, patch and zero energy mode tests. The spatially isotropic behavior is an important requirement for triangular shell elements. The element behavior should not depend on the sequence of node numbering, i.e. the element orientation [1]. The numerical procedure for the isotropy element test is given in Refs. [1,10]. The MITC3i and MITC3+ shell elements pass this test. We perform three patch tests: the membrane, bending and shearing patch tests, see Refs. [1,2] for the patch tests performed. The constant stress ﬁelds should be calculated to pass the patch tests. The MITC3i and MITC3+ shell elements pass the three patch tests. In the zero energy mode test, the number of zero eigenvalues of the stiffness matrix of a single unsupported element are counted

ð15Þ

In order to render the in-plane twisting stiffness more ﬂexible, the linear part is modiﬁed by using three new tying points (D), (E) and (F) instead of the tying points (1)–(3) when we evaluate c in Eq. (11)

The tying positions (D), (E) and (F) are positioned on the three internal lines from the barycenter to the centers of the edges with d deﬁned in Fig. 5(c) and Table 1. As d varies from 1/6 to 0, the three tying positions move from the centers of the edges to the barycenter, resulting in a smaller in-plane twisting stiffness. An effective value for d is determined below.

[1,2]. For the MITC3i and MITC3+ shell elements, only the six zero eigenvalues corresponding to the six rigid body modes are obtained when the distance d deﬁned for the tying positions (D), (E) and (F) in Fig. 5(c) is non-zero. As d approaches 0, the eigenvalue corresponding to the in-plane twisting mode in Fig. 4 decreases and is zero when d = 0. A similar phenomenon was investigated for the MITC3-HR shell element in Ref. [10], where it was shown that by decreasing the stiffness for the in-plane twisting mode, it is possible to improve the performance of 3-node shell elements. Therefore, we perform the in-plane twisting mode test given in Ref. [10] and investigate the effect of the distance d.

We calculate the strain energies (Et) of the MITC3i and MITC3+ shell elements when the elements are subjected to the in-plane twisting mode in Fig. 4. We use L = 1.0, E = 1.7472 Â 107 and m = 0.3. The in-plane twisting mode is given by prescribing the pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ rotations at the nodes to be h1 ¼ h3 ¼ h1 ¼ h2 ¼ 1= 12 and x x y y pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ h2 ¼ h3 ¼ À2= 12. Fig. 6 gives the strain energies of the MITC3i x y and MITC3+ shell elements as a function of the distance d. When the distance d approaches zero, both shell elements become rapidly more ﬂexible in the in-plane twisting mode. Tables 2 and 3 present the eigenvalues of the stiffness matrices of the MITC3i and MITC3+ shell elements for the element geometry shown in Fig. 4(a). We consider t/L = 1/10, 000, E = 1.7472 Â 107 and m = 0.3. The eigenvalue corresponding to the in-plane twisting mode decreases as the distance d decreases but is larger than the smallest eigenvalue of a bending mode. Based on this study we choose and always use the distance d = 1/10,000. As a consequence, the element formulation contains no spurious zero energy mode, and the ellipticity condition is satisﬁed. Note that, due to the bubble function enrichment, the MITC3+ shell element contains two additional bending modes compared to the MITC3i shell element.

4. Convergence studies In this section, we perform convergence studies using appropriate benchmark problems to study the behavior of shell elements: a clamped square plate problem, a sixty-degree skew plate problem, cylindrical shell problems, and hyperboloid shell problems [1–3,30]. These problem solutions pertain to measuring the errors in an appropriate norm considering membrane and bending dominated problems with various shell curvatures, shell thickness values, and boundary conditions. To measure the error in the ﬁnite element solution, we use the s-norm proposed by Hiller and Bathe [31]

Fig. 6. Strain energy stored in the MITC3i and MITC3+ shell elements depending on the distance d in the in-plane twisting mode. Since the strain energy is proportional to t Á L2 in the in-plane twisting mode, Et is the strain energy normalized by t Á L2.

in which h is the element size. For a 3-node shell element to be uniformly optimal, the value of C must be constant, that is, independent of the shell thickness, and k = 2. In this study, well-converged reference solutions calculated using ﬁne meshes of the MITC9 shell elements are used. The MITC9 shell element satisﬁes the ellipticity and consistency conditions and shows a good convergence behavior [20,30–34]. 4.1. Fully clamped square plate problem We solve the plate bending problem shown in Fig. 7. A square plate of dimensions 2L Â 2L and uniform thickness t is subjected to a uniform pressure. All edges are fully clamped (in hard conditions [2]). Due to symmetry, only a one-quarter model is considered, with the following boundary conditions: ux = hy = 0 along BC, uy = hx = 0 along DC and ux = uy = uz = hx = hy = 0 along AB and AD.

Fig. 8 gives the convergence curves of the MITC3, MITC3i and MITC3+ elements. A 96 Â 96 element mesh of the MITC9 shell element is used to obtain the reference solution. We use N Â N element meshes (N = 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64) to calculate the solutions using the triangular shell elements. The element size in the convergence curves is h = L/N. The performance of the MITC3+ shell element is best among them and, practically, uniformly optimal. The improved predictive capability of the MITC3i element is observed when compared with the performance of the MITC3 element.

The simply supported skew plate with its edges of length 2L and uniform thickness t is subjected to a uniform pressure. The boundary condition uz = 0 is imposed along all edges [30]. The convergence behavior of the MITC3, MITC3i and MITC3+ shell elements is shown in Fig. 10. The reference solutions are obtained using a 128 Â 128 element mesh of MITC9 shell elements. The solutions of the triangular shell elements are calculated using N Â N element meshes (N = 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128). The element size is h = 2L/N. The performance of the MITC3+ shell element is much better than those of the other elements. 4.3. Cylindrical shell problems We consider the cylindrical shell of length 2L, radius R and uniform thickness t as shown in Fig. 11. The loading is a smoothly varying pressure p(h)

This shell structure shows different asymptotic behaviors depending on the boundary conditions at its ends. When both ends are free, a bending dominated problem is solved, whereas when both ends are clamped, a membrane dominated problem is considered.

Using symmetry, only the region ABCD in Fig. 11 is modeled. To have the membrane dominated problem, the clamped boundary condition is imposed: ux = b = 0 along BC, uy = a = 0 along DC, uz = a = 0 along AB, and ux = uy = uz = a = b = 0 along AD. To have the bending dominated problem, the free boundary condition is imposed: ux = b = 0 along BC, uy = a = 0 along DC, and uz = a = 0 along AB. Figs. 12 and 13 give the convergence curves of the MITC3, MITC3i and MITC3+ shell elements for the clamped and free cylindrical shell problems. The reference solutions are calculated using a 96 Â 96 element mesh of MITC9 shell elements. The solutions using the MITC3, MITC3i and MITC3+ shell elements are obtained with N Â N element meshes (N = 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64). The element size is h = L/N. In these problem solutions, the MITC3, MITC3i and MITC3+ shell elements present similarly good convergence behaviors. We then perform the convergence studies with the distorted meshes shown in Fig. 14. When an N Â N element mesh is used, each edge is discretized in the following ratio: L1: L2: L3: . . . LN = 1: 2: 3: . . . N. Figs. 15 and 16 show the convergence curves

for the clamped and free cylindrical shell problems, respectively. The MITC3+ shell element shows an excellent performance. 4.4. Hyperboloid shell problems Finally, we consider the hyperboloid shell shown in Fig. 17. The mid-surface of the shell structure is given by

A bending dominated behavior is obtained with free ends and a membrane dominated behavior is given with clamped ends. The bending dominated problem is known to be difﬁcult to solve accurately [3]. Due to symmetry, the analyses are performed using one-eighth of the structure corresponding to the shaded region ABCD in

Fig. 17(a). For the membrane dominated case, the clamped boundary condition is imposed: uz = b = 0 along BC, ux = b = 0 along AD, and uy = a = 0 along DC, and ux = uy = uz = a = b = 0 along AB. For the bending dominated case, the free boundary condition is imposed: uz = b = 0 along BC, ux = b = 0 along AD, and uy = a = 0 along DC. In both cases, a 96 Â 96 element mesh of MITC9 shell elements is used to obtain the reference solutions. The solutions of the MITC3, MITC3i and MITC3+ shell elements are calculated using N Â N element meshes (N = 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64). The element size is h = L/N. In ﬃﬃthe clamped hyperboloid shell case, a boundary layer p of width 6 t is considered for half of the mesh, see Fig. 17(b). In the free hyperboloid shell case, the thin boundary layer is not specially considered [3].

Figs. 18 and 19 show the convergence curves for the clamped and free hyperboloid shell problems. In the clamped hyperboloid shell case, the performance of all three shell elements is similarly good. However, in the free hyperboloid shell case, the MITC3+ shell element shows a much better convergence behavior compared to the others. Figs. 20 and 21 give the convergence curves of the MITC3, MITC3i and MITC3+ shell elements when the distorted meshes in Fig. 14 are used. The MITC3+ shell element displays even here an excellent convergence behavior. We ﬁnally note that, in all the numerical studies in Sections 3 and 4, the standard 7-point Gauss integration is employed to calculate the stiffness matrix of the MITC3+ shell element [2]. If the standard 3-point Gauss integration is used for the MITC3+ shell

element, all the basic numerical tests are also passed and similar convergence behaviors are observed. 5. Concluding remarks In this study, we developed a new triangular shell element that shows considerable promise for general use. The MITC3+ element is based on the ‘basic mathematical shell model’ [3,35] and the MITC approach used for the development of triangular elements [1] but using a cubic bubble function for the rotations and a new assumed transverse shear strain ﬁeld. For comparison, we also considered a shell element, in which the standard displacement interpolation of the 3-node shell element and the new assumed transverse shear strain ﬁeld are used. All shell elements considered pass the basic numerical tests, the isotropy, zero energy mode, and patch tests, and the MITC3+ shell element shows an excellent convergence behavior, even when using distorted element meshes. While only linear analysis conditions have been considered, the element formulation can directly be extended for large deformation analyses since only the usual MITC procedure has been used. In this paper, the effectiveness of the MITC3+ shell element was demonstrated only numerically, and a mathematical analysis would be very valuable to obtain further insight into the element behavior.
