Composite stiffened plates have been analysed for large deflection using the finite element method. An eight noded isoparametric laminated stiffened plate bending element developed earlier has been used. The element has the capability of including transverse shear deformation for the plate and the stiffener and incorporating one or more stiffeners anywhere within the element. The finite element analysis has been made using Mindlin’s formulation and with the assumption of small rotation. The nonlinear equilibrium equations are solved by the Newton-Raphson iteration procedure. Plates and stiffened plates of isotropic and anisotropic material with different boundary conditions have been analysed and results have been compared with those available. Parametric studies have also been carried out.

INTRODUCTION
With the increased application of fibre reinforced composites in various fields, research on their behaviour in different structural forms has also increased. Most commonly used structural forms are plates and shells, used in aircraft and ships’ structures. Stiffened forms have been proved to be more efficient than the unstiffened ones as the former provide effective use of the material. Research on stiffened composite plates has been directed, so far, mostly towards buckling and post-buckling analysis. A few studies on the vibration analysis have recently been found. It is observed that the flexural behaviour of composite stiffened plates has not been studied fully. Very few investigations that have been carried out so far are restricted to small deflections only. At

higher loads, the transverse deflection of plate is large compared to its thickness. The bendingstretching coupling comes into play and the load deflection behaviour ceases to be linear. A large deflection analysis gives accurate responses. For composite plates coupling effects arising from ply orientations make the matter more complicated. The large deflection flexural response of composite plates has been extensively studied in recent years.2
Even with its growing importance, studies on the large deflection behaviour of composite stiffened plates are rather meagre. Turvey’* has analysed uniformly loaded ring-stiffened composite circular plates for large deflection. In his modelling, the effect of a stiffener has been incorporated in the plate by considering statically equivalent local body forces acting on the plate.

The large deflection equations have been solved by the finite difference scheme. Liao and Reddy” have investigated the large deflection behaviour of composite stiffened plates and shells by the finite element method. They have used degenerated three dimensional shell elements and associated curved beam elements which have been derived from the degenerated elements by imposing appropriate kinematic constraints. The incremental equations of motion developed using the principle of virtual displacement of a continuum and the total Lagrangian concept have been solved by the Newton-Raphson iteration procedure.
The experimental investigation on the tlexural behaviour of composite stiffened plate in the nonlinear range has been carried out by Hyer rr a1.j They have used the STAGS (Almroth & Brogan’) computer code to compare the experimental results with the analytical ones. STAGS models the stiffened plate as shell branches.
In the present paper, an eight-noded isoparametric composite stiffened plate bending element developed earlier (Chattopadhyay et cd.“) has been used for the nonlinear analysis. The element’s ability to include transverse shear deformation for both the plate and the stiffener and to take into account any number of stiffeners within the element has been discussed by them. Nonlinear equilibrium equations have been derived using the principle of virtual work. The finite element formulation has been made using Mindlin’s hypothesis and with the total Lagrangian concept. Nonlinear equilibrium equations arc solved by the Newton-Raphson iteraction procedure.
Stiffened and unstiffened rectangular plates of isotropic and composite materials have been solved for large deflection flexure and results are compared with those available in the literature. Parametric studies have also been carried out.
FORMULATION
As stated earlier, an eight noded isoparametric element has been employed to model the stiffened plate. The element matrices of the stiffened plate element consists of the contributions of the plate and that of the stiffener. The formulations for the element has been presented by Chattopadhyay et al.” and as such the same is not repeated here. Only the formulation for nonlinear equilibrium equations and their solutions has been presented

in this paper. The formulation is based on Mindlin’s hypothesis and with the assumptions of small rotation. Total Lagrangian approach has been adopted. Nonlinear equilibrium equations have been derived using the principle of virtual work.
Virtual work equation
For an elastic continuum undergoing small or large displacement, the equilibrium of internal and external forces can be expressed by the virtual work equation as:

{q}d{d}‘= d/c}‘@}-{R}d{6}“={0}

(1)

!,

where j 6 } = nodal displacements of the discretised continuum,
{ R ] = generalised external nodal forces, { II,) = Resultant of internal and external forces. {E} and {CT] represent strains and stresses as usual. Now,

d{e}=[B]d{6}

(2)

[B] is different from [I?] in the sense that [B] contains terms which are dependent on displacements when displacements are large.
Combining eqns ( 1) and (2) yields

{v}d{6}‘= d(6}“[~]7jo}-(R}d{6}‘={O} I I’
or,

Equation (3) is the nonlinear equation of equilibrium to be solved. The integrals are carried out element by element and the contributions to nodal equilibrium are summed in the usual manner. Therefore eqn (3) can represent the equilibrium equation either at element level or in the assembled form.
Variation of strain

To show the accuracy and applicability of the present formulation, a few problems on bare and stiffened plates of isotropic and laminated anisotropic materials have been solved. The results have been compared with those available in the literature. For all the problems solved, applied loading is uniformly distributed and tolerance level is 1%. The stresses have been calculated at Gauss points and extrapolated to get them at nodes using bilinear extrapolation. 4 x 4 mesh divisions have been used for the quarter plate for all the problems except where specifically mentioned.

Isotropic stiffened plates
The problem of isotropic square plates simply supported at four edges and stiffened by central stiffeners, one in each direction, has been solved. Geometry and boundary conditions of the plate are given by Reddy. ” Material properties used by Reddy are E=2.07~ 10” N/m’ and ~=03.

Rectangular plates, clamped along all the edges and having one central stiffener parallel to the x2 direction, have been solved by Koko and Olson6 using super elements. Using symmetry, half of the plate is modelled with 6 x 6 mesh divisions (Fig. 4). Geometry of the plate and the material properties are available from Koko and Olson’@ paper.

Bending moment M_,.2of the cross-ply stiffened plate is higher than Mx,. This indicates that the structure is stiffer in the xz direction. This is due to the fact that the layers in the x2 direction are arranged in a particular sequence (preferred for

For the purpose of the study an eccentrically stiffened cross-ply square plate has been considered. The stiffeners are placed along the x2 direction.

using a quarter plate model and those with two stiffeners using a half plate model. The details of mesh divisions are presented in Figs 9a and 9b. The material properties are the same as those used by Liao and Reddy.x The results are presented in Figs 1Oa, lob, 11 and 12. Figures 1Oa and 10b show the load deflection characteristics of the plate for different stiffener eccentricities, having one and two stiffeners respectively. From these figures it can be observed that the stiffness of the composite stiffened plate increases with the increase in the stiffener eccentricity. Also the nonlinear effects are reduced with the increase in the number of stiffeners.
Figure 11 shows the load deflection curves for the plate with varying numbers of stiffeners having the same eccentricity. From this figure it can be observed that the increase in the number of stiffeners increases the stiffness of the composite plate. In Fig. 12, the deflection patterns of the stiffened plate along the centre line parallel to the x, direction is presented for a constant load level and varying number of stiffeners. This figure illustrates the change in the deflection pattern with the increase in number of stiffeners.

CONCLUSIONS
Formulations for geometrically nonlinear analysis of laminated composite plates with laminated stiffeners has been presented in this paper. It is evident from the results that the stiffened composite plate bending element developed earlier (Chattopadhyay et d3) performs well in the nonlinear range for both isotropic and anisotropic stiffened plates.
The formulation is simple and can be easily programmed.
For the type of stiffener presented in this paper, the ply orientations of the plate and the stiffener can be arranged properly to achieve desired stiffness properties in any direction. The + 45” orientations in the plate and the stiffener give similar stiffness properties in either of the orthogonal directions.
For a composite plate the stiffness can be increased either by increasing the number of stiffeners or by increasing the stiffener eccentricity. Though rectangular stiffened plates have been analysed in the present paper, stiffened plates of

any arbitrary planform can be analysed. It can be shown (Chattopadhyay et ~1.~) that the stiffener formulation of the present element can be modified to include general open-section stiffeners.
The present formulation can be extended to include nonlinear dynamic postbuckling and other aspects of analysis of composite stiffened plates.
