In this paper, we develop a scheme to enrich the 3-node triangular MITC shell ﬁnite element by interpolation cover functions. The MITC method is used for the standard and enriched displacement interpolations. The enriched 3-node shell ﬁnite element not only captures higher gradients but also decreases inter-elemental stress jumps. In particular, the enrichment scheme increases the solution accuracy without any traditional local mesh reﬁnement. Convergence studies considering a fully clamped square plate problem, cylindrical shell problems, and hyperboloid shell problems demonstrate the good predictive capability of the enriched MITC3 shell ﬁnite element, even when distorted meshes are used. We evaluate the effectiveness of the method, and also illustrate the use of the enrichment scheme applied only locally through the solution of two additional shell problems: a shaft–shaft interaction problem and a monster shell problem.

1. Introduction The ﬁnite element method is a popular and effective procedure for the analysis of solid, ﬂuid, and multi-physics problems. The key for its success is mainly due to the fact that meshes can be used to span over complicated domain geometries. However, the solution accuracy highly depends on how the geometries are meshed. To obtain reliable solutions with desired accuracy, special mesh reﬁnements are frequently required, in particular, in areas where non-smooth and near-singular solutions are sought [1]. To obtain more accurate solutions, a promising approach is to incorporate special enrichment functions within traditional ﬁnite element formulations. For example, Bathe and Chaudhary [2] and Yoon et al. [3] successfully used enriched displacements to analyze warping effects in beam problems. Benzley [4] and Dvorkin et al. [5], Belytschko and Black [6], Moes et al. [7] and Daux et al. [8] employed enrichment functions to account for various singularities in solid mechanics problems. Babuška and Melenk [9] showed in general, mathematically, how to include Ansatz spaces containing the local properties of solutions. Recently, Kim and Bathe [10] developed and studied a ﬁnite element method in which interpolation covers are used. The scheme increases the solution accuracy of the traditional low-order ﬁnite element discretization of solids without any changes in the mesh. The major advantage of the method is that the higher order enrichment is available without introducing additional nodes. That is,

traditional nodal point movements or mesh reﬁnements are not used to improve the solution accuracy. The enrichment scheme not only captures higher gradients but also decreases inter-element stress jumps. Due to discontinuities in geometries (curvature or thickness), incompatibilities of boundary conditions, and irregularities in the loading, shell structures frequently experience stress layers. Within stress layers, the displacements vary rapidly and induce concentrations of strain energies [11,12]. To achieve a desired solution accuracy in such stress layers, a sufﬁciently ﬁne mesh and/or higher order interpolation functions are required [1]. But the use of traditional mesh reﬁnement procedures can be computationally demanding and tedious for complex shell geometries [13]. In several studies, enrichment functions have been employed for plates and shells, but these studies have focused on special local enrichments near cracks [14–17] rather than on a general enrichment scheme that may be used for various areas of the shell structure. Displacement-based shell ﬁnite elements become too stiff in bending situations when the thickness is relatively small [1]. The phenomenon is called locking. For a long time, there have been numerous attempts to alleviate the locking of plate and shell ﬁnite elements [1]. As well established, using the pure displacement-based method in general shell analyses, locking cannot be eliminated [18]. A major advancement has been accomplished by the MITC (Mixed Interpolation of Tensorial Components) method for quadrilateral and triangular plate and shell elements [18–28]. However, a particularly difﬁcult task is to obtain a general 3-node shell element that is effective for the analysis of all shell structures.

The aim of this paper is to develop a 3-node triangular shell ﬁnite element enriched by linear interpolation covers within the MITC framework. The key idea is to use and treat the assumed covariant transverse shear strain ﬁelds separately for the standard linear and the additional quadratic displacement interpolations. The MITC3 shell ﬁnite element enriched by interpolation covers passes the patch tests and shows in example solutions good convergence behavior even when distorted meshes are used. Highly varying stresses in shells can be captured by only locally using interpolation covers. In the following sections, the ﬁnite element procedure to enrich by interpolation covers is brieﬂy reviewed and then the formulation of the enriched MITC3 shell ﬁnite element is presented. We discuss the key theoretical and numerical aspects of the scheme regarding the computational expense and the convergence of the method. The results of convergence studies considering a fully clamped square plate problem, cylindrical shell problems, and hyperboloid shell problems are given. Two illustrative example solutions, a shaft–shaft interaction problem and a ‘highly-sensitive’ shell problem, show the effectiveness of using the enriched MITC3 shell ﬁnite element also only locally, that is, only in areas of high stress gradients. 2. The ﬁnite element method enriched by interpolation covers Enriching the ﬁnite element procedure is in principle, and theoretically, straightforward but difﬁculties are encountered in obtaining effective schemes [6–10,29–33]. To introduce the basic procedure for the enrichment scheme considered here, let us brieﬂy consider in this section a two-dimensional analysis problem. Let Q n ¼ fxi gn be a set of n nodal point position vectors i¼1 q xi ¼ ½ xi yi T 2 X, and let fkh g ¼ fwm gm¼1 be a family of q triangles n generated by Q .

Considering Eq. (4), the enriched cover approximation consists of the standard ﬁnite element interpolation plus additional higher order terms. To obtain a well-conditioned stiffness matrix, we use the local coordinate systems (ni, gi) instead of the global coordinates (x, y) and always (although not  mentioned in the example solutions) enforce not only ui ¼ 0 ^ but also ui ¼ 0 when imposing the essential boundary conditions at the node i. The basic properties of the ﬁnite element method enriched by interpolation covers were studied for general 2D and 3D ﬁnite element analyses in Ref. [10]. These basic properties pertain also to the ﬁnite element analysis of shells. 3. The enriched MITC3 shell ﬁnite element In this section, we present the displacement interpolation of the MITC3 shell ﬁnite element enriched by the linear interpolation cover. Therefore, the resulting enriched displacement interpolation can give quadratic convergence. We also present the assumed covariant strain ﬁelds used for the enriched MITC3 shell ﬁnite element. 3.1.

The triangles do not overlap, that is, wj \ wk ¼ £ for j – k. Fig. 1(a) shows the piecewise interpolation function hi(x, y) used in the solution. Let Ci be the support domain of hi, i.e. C i ¼ supp ðhi Þ; 8i ¼ 1; . . . ; N, which we call the cover region. Hence the cover region Ci corresponds to the union of elements attached to the node i, see Fig. 1(b). For each wm, let ic(m) be the set of cover indices deﬁned by

in which ij and ^ij correspond to the standard linear and additional e e quadratic displacement interpolations, respectively. To alleviate the locking phenomenon, we use the MITC method for the covariant transverse shear strains. However, different assumed covariant transverse shear strain ﬁelds are employed for the standard and additional quadratic displacement interpolations. The assumed covariant transverse shear strain ﬁelds of the MITC3 and MITC6 shell elements are used for the strains ij and ^ij , respectively [23]. Note that, in the MITC6 shell elee e ment, the covariant membrane strains are also assumed to reduce membrane locking, but this treatment is not necessary and not used for the enriched MITC3 shell element due to its ﬂat geometry. The assumed covariant transverse shear strain ﬁeld used for the standard displacement interpolation is [23]

   ^ ^ b ui ; ai ; bi and the additional degrees of freedom ui ; ai ; ^i . Note that we do not use assumed covariant strain ﬁelds for other covariant strain components and hence the scheme will not give spurious modes in membrane strains [25,34]. Then, using the appropriate stress–strain matrix for shells, the element stiffness is constructed in the same manner as for the displacement-based shell element [1]. The 7-point Gauss integration is adopted to evaluate the stiffness matrix because the order of the enriched displacement interpolation is quadratic. Since the cover interpolation is based on the existing nodes, the enriched displacement interpolation can be locally used assigning or not assigning interpolation covers in different regions. Without enrichment, the element is identical to the original MITC3 shell element. The enriched MITC3 shell element passes the membrane, bending, and transverse shearing patch tests for arbitrary local enrichments, see Refs. [1,18,23,28] for the patch tests performed. Of course, in the tests, the nodal forces corresponding    to not only the standard degrees of freedom (ui ; ai and bi ) ^ ^ but also the additional degrees of freedom (ui ; ai and ^i ) must b be applied [10]. 4. Computational efﬁciency In this section, we study some important aspects of the computational efﬁciency when using the enriched element. The standard 3- and 6-node shell elements (the MITC3 and MITC6 shell elements) and the enriched 3-node shell element (the enriched MITC3 shell element) are considered. We ﬁrst study the size and sparseness of the stiffness matrices when using the enriched 3-node shell ﬁnite element and the standard 3- and 6-node shell elements for the meshes shown in Fig. 4. A simply supported square plate problem is considered. The meshes used are given in Fig. 4(a)–(c) when N = 8. Since the stan-

dard 3-node shell element is based on the linear displacement interpolation, and the 6-node and enriched 3-node shell elements are based on quadratic displacement interpolations, we use a twice ﬁner mesh for the standard 3-node shell element. The stiffness matrix entries for the simply supported square plate problem for some equivalent mesh patterns are plotted in Fig. 4(d)–(f), where the non-zero entries are colored in black. The size of the stiffness matrices for the meshes used is 803 Â 803 for the 3- and 6-node shell elements and 633 Â 633 for the enriched 3-node shell element. The standard 3- and 6-node shell elements and the enriched 3-node shell element give 15,313, 24,581 and 32,797 non-zero entries in the matrices, respectively. Also, the matrix half-bandwidths are 51, 100 and 83 for the 3- and 6node shell elements and the enriched 3-node shell element, respectively. Table 1 lists the information regarding these cases.

The solid and dotted lines correspond to the results obtained by the mesh patterns in Fig. 6(a) and (b), respectively. The bold line represents the optimal convergence rate, which is 2.0 for linear elements and 4.0 for quadratic elements.

The number of non-zero entries in the stiffness matrix for the enriched 3-node shell element is substantially larger than in the corresponding matrix for the 6-node shell element. This is due to the fact that the support of the higher order interpolation functions in the enriched 3-node shell element is larger than for the 3- and 6-node shell elements. However, using the enriched 3-node shell element, all degrees of freedom are associated with vertex nodes which are shared by several elements and the assembled system of equations is in general smaller than when using the 6-node shell element where edge nodes are only shared by 2 elements. Therefore, the enriched 3-node shell element gives less equations and here also a smaller bandwidth than the 6-node shell element. This fact shows the effectiveness of the enriched 3-node shell element from a computational point of view. Fig. 5 shows how the number of nodal degrees of freedom increases

as a function of the number of elements used in the meshing of Fig. 4. It is valuable to compare solution times required for the three shell ﬁnite elements considered. In all the cases, of course, symmetric stiffness matrices are generated. To obtain more insight into the computational efforts needed in the respective solutions, we focus on the solution of the linear equations using direct Gauss elimination, in which the factorization of the stiffness matrices represents the major expense. To check computational times, we use a quad-core machine (Intel(R) Core i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40 GHz, 8 GB RAM, Windows 7 64bit) for all solution cases. Table 2 shows the solution times for the simply supported square plate problem. As expected, the factorization time for the enriched 3-node shell element is much smaller than for the standard 6-node shell element.

5. Convergence studies

z
In this section, we perform convergence studies on wellestablished problems for the enriched MITC3 shell element. The solutions can show at most quadratic convergence in the s-norm and the results are compared with those of the MITC3, MITC4, and MITC6 shell elements. We solve various problems: a fully clamped square plate problem, cylindrical shell problems, and hyperboloid shell problems using uniform and distorted meshes [23,24,27,28,35]. The s-norm proposed by Hiller and Bathe [36] is used to measure the convergence of the ﬁnite element solutions. The s-norm is suitable to check whether the ﬁnite element solutions satisfy consistency and the inf-sup condition [36–40], and is deﬁned as follows

important to use accurate reference solutions calculated by a reliable shell ﬁnite element. In this study, we use well-converged reference solutions calculated using ﬁne meshes of the MITC9 shell ﬁnite element. Of course, the MITC9 shell ﬁnite element is known to satisfy the ellipticity and consistency conditions and to show adequate convergence behavior, see Refs. [22,35,36]. In the following sections, we present the convergence curves of the MITC3, MITC4, MITC6 shell elements and the fully enriched MITC3 shell element to identify the performance of the enriched MITC3 shell element compared to other shell elements. Note that some convergence curves of the MITC3, MITC4, and MITC6 shell elements have been published before in Refs. [23,24,27]. 5.1. Fully clamped square plate problem The plate problem shown in Fig. 6 is solved. A square plate of size 2L Â 2L and constant thickness t is subjected to a uniform

pressure load. Due to symmetry, only one quarter of the plate is   h h modeled, with ux ¼ y ¼ 0 along BC, uy ¼ x ¼ 0 along DC, and    ux ¼ uy ¼ uz ¼ x ¼ y ¼ 0 along AB and AD [23,24]. h h We study the convergence behavior not only using uniform meshes but also distorted meshes, as shown in Fig. 7. When the N Â N distorted mesh is used, each edge is divided by the ratio L1 : L2 : L3 : . . . ; LN ¼ 1 : 2 : 3 : . . . N, leading to quite distorted meshes. The reference solution is obtained with a uniform mesh of 96 Â 96 MITC9 shell ﬁnite elements. We use N = 8, 16, 32 and 64 for the MITC3 and MITC4 shell elements, and N = 4, 8, 16 and 32 for the MITC6 shell element and the enriched MITC3 shell element. Note that in these N Â N meshes N2 MITC4 elements and 2N2 triangular elements are used throughout the paper. Also, in the ﬁgures of results we consider the cases t/L = 1/100, 1/1000 and 1/10,000 and use as the ‘‘element size’’ h = L/N. To fairly compare convergence behaviors among different shell elements, the equivalent element sizes 2h, h and 1.2h are used for the MITC3

and MITC4 shell elements, the MITC6 shell element, and the enriched MITC3 shell element. When using these equivalent element sizes, the numbers of degrees of freedom are similar. To identify the dependency of the convergence behavior on the MITC scheme chosen for the enriched MITC3 shell element, the following three schemes are considered for the covariant transverse shear strain ﬁeld of the additional quadratic displacement interpolation: – No MITC scheme is used (denoted by DISP in Fig. 8). – The MITC6a scheme is used, for this scheme see Ref. [23]. – The MITC6 scheme in Eq. (13) is used (referred to as MITC6b in Fig. 8) In all these cases, of course, the MITC3 scheme in Eq. (12) is used for the assumed covariant transverse shear strain ﬁeld of the standard linear displacement interpolation.

Fig. 8 shows the convergence curves of the original MITC3 shell element and the enriched MITC3 shell elements based on the different assumptions for the transverse shear strain ﬁelds. The enriched MITC3 shell element shows different solution accuracy highly depending on the assumed covariant transverse shear strain ﬁeld used. When the assumed covariant transverse shear strain ﬁeld of the MITC6 shell element is employed, an almost ideal convergence behavior is observed in this fully clamped square plate problem. Note that the other enriched MITC3 shell elements show an even worse convergence behavior than the original MITC3 shell element. Therefore, in the following sections, we only use the enriched MITC3 shell element based on the MITC6 scheme in Eq. (13). Figs. 9 and 10 present the convergence curves for the fully clamped square plate problems using uniform and distorted meshes, respectively. The performance of the enriched MITC3 shell element is much better than the performance of the MITC3 and MITC6 shell elements. One reason is probably that the enrichments

Figs. 12 and 13 present the convergence behaviors for the clamped cylindrical shell problems with uniform and distorted meshes, respectively. All the shell ﬁnite elements considered show excellent convergence behavior with uniform and distorted meshes. Figs. 14 and 15 present the convergence curves for the free cylindrical shell problems obtained with uniform and distorted

When both ends are clamped, a membrane-dominated problem is obtained, and when the ends are free, a bending-dominated problem is obtained. The bending-dominated hyperboloid shell problem is known to be difﬁcult to solve [23,24,41]. Due to symmetry, the analyses are carried out using one-eighth of the structure, corresponding to the shaded region ABCD in Fig. 16(a). For the membrane-dominated case, the clamped bound    ary condition is imposed using: uz ¼ b ¼ 0 along BC, ux ¼ b ¼ 0     y ¼ a ¼ 0 along DC, and ux ¼ uy ¼ uz ¼ a ¼ b ¼ 0    along AD, and u along AB. For the bending- dominated case, the free boundary con    dition is imposed using: uz ¼ b ¼ 0 along BC, ux ¼ b ¼ 0 along AD,   y ¼ a ¼ 0 along DC [23,24]. and u In common with previous problems, we use the reference solutions calculated with a mesh of 96 Â 96 MITC9 shell elements. The solutions using the MITC3, MITC4, MITC6 and enriched MITC3 shell elements are obtained with N Â N meshes (N = 8, 16, 32 and 64 for the MITC3 and MITC4 shell elements and N = 4, 8, 16, and 32 for the MITC6 and enriched MITC3 shell elements). The element size used in the convergence curves is h = L/N. In the pﬃﬃ clamped hyperboloid shell problem, a boundary layer of width 6 t is used for half of the mesh, see Fig. 16(b). In the free hyperboloid shell problem, the thin boundary layer is not specially meshed. Figs. 17 and 18 show the convergence curves for both uniform and distorted meshes in the membrane dominated case (that is, the clamped hyperboloid shell problem). The performance of all shell elements is good. For the bending-dominated case (that is, the free hyperboloid shell problem), the convergence curves are shown in Figs. 19 and 20. The enriched MITC3 shell element shows the best convergence behavior among the shell elements considered. Even in the use of distorted meshes, the performance of the enriched MITC3 shell element is excellent while the other shell elements show some degree of locking. 6. Local use of cover interpolations In the convergence studies given in Section 5, we showed a good performance when the enriched MITC3 shell element is used throughout the mesh. In this section, we illustrate the local use of cover interpolation functions over the solution domains. This scheme of increasing the solution accuracy is quite different from

element and the fully and locally enriched shell models. The red dots in Fig. 22(e) represent the selected nodes carrying interpolation covers around the ﬁllet area where stress concentration is expected. Table 3 gives the numbers of elements, nodes, degrees of freedom used, and the relative errors in the maximum effective stress obtained when using the shell models in Fig. 22. In the shaft–shaft interaction problem, the maximum effective stress is obtained around the ﬁllet area. Using the local enrichments, the maximum effective stress is well predicted with a much smaller number of degrees of freedom. 6.2. A ‘‘highly-sensitive’’ shell problem Fig. 23 shows the problem considered (referred to also as ‘‘the monster shell problem’’) [12]. The shell geometry corresponds to a half-sphere with the top sliced off. The shell is clamped around its entire lower boundary. A smoothly distributed pressure is applied over a small part of the interior of the shell. Since there

is no exact solution to the problem, we use the reference solution given by a ﬁne mesh of 48 (axial) Â 192 (circumferential) MITC4 shell elements; see Fig. 24(a). This is a sufﬁciently ﬁne mesh to identify and reasonably resolve the boundary layer on the free edge. Fig. 24(b) presents a ﬁner mesh of MITC3 shell elements, and Fig. 24(c)–(e) show a coarser mesh for the MITC3 shell element and the fully and locally enriched cases. Fig. 24 shows the calculated deformed shapes of the shell when the shell thickness is 0.001 (t/L = 1/10,000). For visualization, the displacements are normalized so that the maximum outward total displacement value is equal to 2.0. We note that the displacements are dominant in the immediate vicinity of the free boundary, namely within the boundary layer. Fig. 24(b) and (c) show that the MITC3 shell element meshes are not effective in predicting the displacement oscillations1 in the circumferential direction ithin the
1 In the monster shell problem, the number of displacement oscillations in the boundary layer increases as the shell thickness decreases. The number is given by log (L/t).

boundary layer. However, when the coarse MITC3 shell element mesh is fully enriched, the displacements in the boundary layer are calculated accurately as shown in Fig. 24(d). Also, the local use of the cover interpolations within the boundary layer results in excellent overall accuracy with a signiﬁcantly reduced number of degrees of freedom, see Fig. 24(e). Table 4 shows the number of elements, nodes and degrees of freedom used, the number of displacement oscillations, and the relative errors in the strain energies. 7. Conclusions In this paper, we have proposed a 3-node shell ﬁnite element enriched by interpolation covers based on the MITC method. The enriched MITC3 shell ﬁnite element is obtained by applying linear displacement interpolation covers to the standard 3-node shell element, and using the MITC procedure. Good convergence behavior in the analysis of various shell problems has been seen, even when distorted meshes are used. The fact that, in the solutions considered, the enriched 3-node element performs sometimes signiﬁcantly better than the MITC4 and MITC6 shell elements when distorted meshes are used is particularly noteworthy. The effectiveness of using the enrichment scheme only locally was also illustrated by using the cover interpolation functions only in critical areas of an analysis domain.

We can conclude that cover interpolations and the MITC method are promising schemes for enriching shell element behaviors. Based on the observed good behavior of the enriched MITC3 shell ﬁnite element, we expect that an enriched MITC4 shell element will likely also be effective when distorted meshes must be used in areas of shell bending. In future studies, it would be valuable to mathematically analyze the method, to further test the scheme, and to develop the method for nonlinear analysis [1,18,43] and for solving problems containing very high stress gradients, like shell problems containing cracks [32,33,44]. In all of these developments, the ultimate aim should probably be to establish automatic procedures for improving stress solutions [45].
