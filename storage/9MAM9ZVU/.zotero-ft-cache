Abstract Static analysis of stiffened shells has been carried out using an eight-noded isoparametric element for the shell and a three-noded curved beam element for the stiffener. A same displacement function is used for the shell and the stiffener elements. A modiï¬ed technique has been followed to analyse the shell, which is an improvement over the degenerated shell concept. The stiffness matrix of the curved beam element is generated irrespective of its position and orientation within the shell element. The stiffness matrix of the stiffener is then transferred to all the nodes of the shell element. Numerical examples of stiffened shells with concentric and eccentric stiffeners have been analysed and the results presented together with those available in published literature.

1. Introduction Stiffened plate and stiffened shell structures have found widespread application in engineering structures such as steel chimneys, fuselages and wings of aircrafts, ships and offshore structures, submarines and so on. Structures comprising of plates/shells stiffened by stiffeners at regular intervals achieve great economy without compromising strength and durability. External loading on the structure due to pay-

load and the environment cause deformations. Hence it becomes necessary to carry out a static analysis to know the actual deformation in the shell and the stiffeners. A review of the research work on isotropic stiffened shells was reported by Sinha and Mukhopadhyay (1995). Satsangi (1984) proposed a new method to calculate the stiffness matrix of arbitrary oriented stiffeners in the plate element for plane stress analysis on the basis of equal displacements at the junction of plate and stiffener, a concept given by Mukhopadhyay (1981). Satsangi and Ray (1998) and Ray and Satsangi (1996) have extended the same concept for the static, dynamic and buckling analyses of stiffened plate structures. In the present work, the same approach has been extended for the static analysis of stiffened shells. The shell is analysed using an eight-noded isoparametric element with a modiï¬ed approach given by Saetta and Vitaliani (1990). The stiffener element is considered as a three-noded isoparametric curved beam element and the stiffness matrix is calculated using the standard principles of ï¬nite element analysis. Then the stiffness matrix is transformed to all the nodes of the shell element by considering the position of the stiffener within the element.

2. Mathematical formulation The present study deals with shell elements that are obtained as an extension of the MindlinâReissner plate elements. The formulation has been carried out employing the eight-noded isoparametric curved quadratic element (Fig. 1). The formulation for the analysis of the shell considered here is an advancement over the degenerated shell approach given by Ahmed et al. (1970). This formulation is equally capable of analysing shallow shell or deep shell structures elegantly. In the formulation of the ï¬nite elements (Zienkiewicz, 1977), the standard parametric equations become

where xi,yi,zi are the co-ordinates of a generic node i belonging to the middle surface of the element that has m nodes, while Ni(x,h) are the bidimensional C0 shape functions for the geometry. On the shell surface S (Fig. 2), two orthogonal intrisinic co-ordinates x and y are deï¬ned. The curvilinear co-ordinates can also be deï¬ned as:

5. Numerical examples 5.1. Example 1: internally pressurised inï¬nite ring stiffened cylindrical shell An isotopic inï¬nitely long cylindrical shell with equally spaced stiffening ribs under the effect of internal pressure (Fig. 6(a)) has been solved using the present ï¬nite element approach. The mesh division and boundary conditions for the analysis strip are shown in Fig. 6(b). Results of maximum normal shell deï¬ection and ring expansion for different sizes of the ring stiffeners are given in Table 1. Results obtained by the present approach are in good agreement with the values obtained by Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger (1959), Venkatesh and Rao (1983) and Sinha (1995). 5.2. Example 2: rigid diaphragm supported eccentrically stiffened cylindrical shell A cylindrical shell roof supported on a rigid diaphragm on its curved boundaries having two eccentric stiffeners at the straight edges is considered for the analysis. Dimension and material properties of the shell are shown in Fig. 7. Material properties of the shell and the stiffener are taken to be the same. The intensity of gravity loading on the cylindrical shell roof is taken as q=4.393 kN/m2. For gravity loading of the stiffener it is considered as qs=Ags, where gs=24 kN/m3 and A is the crosssectional area of the stiffener. The computations are carried out for the bare shell and stiffened shell with different stiffener dimensions mentioned in Table 2. The example has also been analysed

B.G. Prusty, S.K. Satsangi / Ocean Engineering 28 (2001) 621â638

by Omurtag and Akoz (1992) by using a four-noded isoparametric rectangular ï¬nite Â¨ element for the shell and two-noded space bars for the stiffeners. Sinha (1995) analysed the same problem using higher order triangular isotropic shallow shell ï¬nite elements. Due to double symmetry a quarter of the shell has been analysed using 4Ã4 mesh. The numerical values of the vertical deï¬ection of the bare and stiffened shell along the edge BC and at crown A obtained by the present method and those of the other investigators are presented in Table 2. Deï¬ection values of the stiffened shell roof are compared with the existing results in Table 2. The comparison shows that the deï¬ection values predicted by the present approach are in good agreement. 5.3. Example 3: doubly curved shell with cross stiffeners A simply supported spherical shell with symmetrical stiffeners has been analysed by the present approach to validate the present analysis for doubly curved stiffened shells. The geometry of the stiffened shell is shown in Fig. 8. This problem has been solved by Liao and Reddy (1989) for the geometric nonlinear analysis and Sinha (1995) for the linear analysis of the stiffened shell. Analysis has been made for the stiffened shell subjected to a 45 kN concentrated load at the centre. A convergence study for the vertical deï¬ection at the centre of the shell has been plotted in Fig. 9. This shows rapid monotonic convergence for displacements as the ï¬nite element mesh sizes increase. The results of the ratio of central deï¬ection to the thickness of the shell for different loadings are plotted in Fig. 10. The displacements agree well with the solution for the linear part of Liao and Reddy (1989) and Sinha (1995).

6. Conclusions A new scheme of analysing the stiffened shell has been carried out in the present work. An eight-noded isoparametric element for the shell and a three-noded isoparametric curved beam element for the stiffener are used throughout the analysis. In this paper, a modiï¬ed approach of a curved shear ï¬exible element is presented. The modiï¬ed approach can be considered as an alternative to the degenerated theory of shell analysis. A new approach of distributing the stiffness values of stiffener to shell nodes using a three-noded curved beam element has been tried and found to be satisfactory. Several examples of isotropic stiffened shell have been analysed to validate the present approach and the results are excellently matched.
