Abstract The objective of this paper is to gain insight into ï¬nite element discretizations of shells using the basic shell mathematical model and, in particular, regarding the sources of ââlockingââ. We brieï¬y review the ââbasic shell mathematical modelââ and present a formulation of shell ï¬nite elements based on this model. These shell ï¬nite elements are equivalent to the widely-used continuum mechanics based shell ï¬nite elements. We consider a free hyperboloid shell problem, which is known to be diï¬cult to solve accurately. Using a ï¬ne mesh of MITC9 elements based on the basic shell mathematical model, a detailed analysis is performed giving the distributions of all strain terms. A similar analysis using the MITC6 shell element shows why this element locks when the shell thickness is very small. Ã 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Since shell structures are very eï¬cient in carrying loads, they have been frequently used in engineering practice [1,2]. Analytical and numerical analyses of shell structures have been carried out for a very long time. However, in spite of the long history of research on shells, the analysis of shell structures still presents challenges due to diï¬culties resulting from the complicated and varying behavior (membrane dominated, bending

dominated and mixed behaviors) of shells, particularly, when the thickness of a shell is small [2â8]. In practice, the ï¬nite element method is the main tool for the analysis of shell structures. Continuum mechanics based shell ï¬nite elements have been commonly used for the analysis of general shell structures [1,2]. These discretizations can, in particular, be used generally for both thick and thin shells. However, while the standard displacement based type of shell element usually works well for membrane dominated shell problems, the element is too stiï¬ for bending dominated and mixed problems when the shell is thin. This major diï¬culty encountered in the ï¬nite element analysis of shells is called ââlockingââ. Eï¬ective ï¬nite element discretizations for the analysis of shells should not lock in bending dominated and mixed problems and perform well in

membrane dominated problems irrespective of the shell thickness. The use of mixed ï¬nite element methods has greatly advanced the ï¬eld and speciï¬cally, mixed interpolated shell ï¬nite elements using the MITC (Mixed Interpolation of Tensorial Components) approach proposed in Refs. [9,10] are employed. The technique is eï¬ective not only for quadrilateral plate/shell elements but also for triangular plate/shell elements [9â12]. Well-established numerical tests have been performed for the MITC shell ï¬nite elements [12â16]. A deeper study of shell structures requires a strong mathematical as well as physical understanding. Shell mathematical models have provided a strong analytical basis for the ï¬nite element analysis of shells. Most classical mathematical shell/plate models can be derived from ââthe basic shell mathematical modelââ which also is the underlying mathematical model of the continuum mechanics based shell ï¬nite elements [2,3]. However, while in the continuum mechanics based shell ï¬nite element the three dimensional continuum strain tensor is used, the basic shell mathematical model explicitly provides the membrane, bending and shear strain terms in the form of a shell theory. The study in this paper is motivated by the fact that, to understand the behavior of the continuum mechanics based shell ï¬nite elements, we can use the basic shell mathematical model. Natural steps are then to develop shell ï¬nite elements based on the basic shell mathematical model and to analyze the strain terms of that model. This study should enable us to gain insight into ï¬nite element discretizations of shells (in particular, when the widely-used continuum mechanics based shell ï¬nite elements are employed), and thus help to further identify the sources of locking in ï¬nite element solutions. In the following sections of this paper, we brieï¬y review the basic shell mathematical model and discuss how we interpolate the geometry and the displacements to construct shell ï¬nite elements based on this mathematical model. Some numerical tests then show that these shell ï¬nite elements are equivalent to the continuum mechanics based shell ï¬nite elements. Using a ï¬ne mesh of MITC9 elements based on the basic shell mathematical model, the detailed analysis results of a free hyperboloid shell problem are then presented. These results show how the strain terms of the basic shell mathematical model vary in the bending dominated shell structure as the shell thickness decreases. A similar analysis using the MITC6 element gives insight into the locking phenomenon.

model has the same strain terms that the continuum mechanics based shell ï¬nite element formulation implicitly contains. In this section, we provide the geometric concepts and notation used, brieï¬y describe the shell kinematics and present the basic shell mathematical model within the framework of linear elasticity considering an isotropic material. We use the same notation as in Ref. [2]. 2.1. Shell geometry Shells are 3D structures with one dimension, the thickness, small compared to the other two dimensions. This geometric feature is used to deï¬ne the geometry of shell structures by specifying only the 2D midsurface and the shell thickness. In what follows, the geometric concepts and notation used in the basic shell mathematical model are described. In order to introduce the deï¬nitions of diï¬erential geometry, we use the Einstein summation convention. The variables a, b, k and l range from 1 to 2 and the variables i, j and k range from 1 to 3. We consider a shell with a midsurface deï¬ned by a 2D chart ~ which is an injective mapping from x into /, S, see Fig. 1. The covariant base vectors of the midsurface are ~a Â¼ a o~ 1 ; n2 Ã /Ã°n : ona Ã°1Ã

The corresponding contravariant base vectors are given by ~a Ã ~b Â¼ db ; a a a db a (db a Ã°2Ã

where denotes the Kronecker symbol Â¼ 1 if b = a and 0 otherwise). We deï¬ne the unit normal vector to the plane as ~3 Â¼ a ~1 Ã ~2 a a : k~1 Ã ~2 k a a Ã°3Ã

The 3D geometry of the shell can then be described by the 3D chart given by ~ UÃ°n1 ; n2 ; n3 Ã Â¼ ~ 1 ; n2 Ã Ã¾ n3~3 Ã°n1 ; n2 Ã /Ã°n a in the 3D reference domain deï¬ned by n i t t ho ; X Â¼ Ã°n1 ; n2 ; n3 Ã 2 R3 jÃ°n1 ; n2 Ã2 x; n3 2 Ã ; 2 2 Ã°4Ã

where t is the thickness (assumed here constant) of the shell. Surface tensors on the midsurface of the shell can now be deï¬ned. We deï¬ne the ï¬rst fundamental form (2D metric tensor) of the midsurface aab Â¼ ~a Ã ~b a a or alternatively in contravariant form a a aab Â¼ ~a Ã ~b : Ã°7Ã Ã°6Ã

2.2. Shell kinematics The basic assumption of the shell kinematics is that straight ï¬bers originally normal to the midsurface remain straight and unstretched during the deformation of the shell, which is expressed by ~ UÃ°n1 ; n2 ; n3 Ã Â¼ ~ 1 ; n2 Ã Ã¾ n3 hk Ã°n1 ; n2 Ã~k Ã°n1 ; n2 Ã; uÃ°n a

Note that hk~k is the rotation vector ~ and n3 hk~k is a a h the displacement due to the ï¬ber rotation.1 The translational displacement ~ is also given in the contravariant u basis ~1 ; ~2 and ~3 Ã°Â¼ ~3 Ã. a a a a For linear analysis, the linear part of the 3D Greenâ Lagrange strain tensor is used 1 eij Â¼ Ã°~i Ã U ;j Ã¾ ~j Ã U ;i Ã; g ~ g ~ 2 where ~ oU Ã°n1 ; n2 ; n3 Ã ~ U ;i Â¼ : oni Ã°19Ã Ã°18Ã

[2,3,17â23] and the references therein.

3. Shell ï¬nite elements based on the basic shell mathematical model Shell ï¬nite elements have been frequently formulated using a speciï¬c shell theory, see e.g. [17â25]. Of course, this is one of the usual approaches to discretize shell continua using ï¬nite element methods. However, as discussed below, when shell ï¬nite elements are formulated using a shell theory, care need be exercised in the interpolation of the geometry and displacements to ensure that rigid body motions can be properly represented. This point has of course been mentioned in the literature. However, we shall actually demonstrate below that otherwise signiï¬cant errors may be observed in the solutions. In order to construct shell ï¬nite elements based on the basic shell mathematical model, we next discuss how to appropriately interpolate the geometry and displacements. Some numerical tests are performed to show the equivalence of the shell ï¬nite elements thus developed with the continuum mechanics based shell ï¬nite elements. While we seem to consider in this section only displacement-based shell elements, our discussion is of course equally applicable to the development of mixed ï¬nite element methods (including the MITC shell elements, see also Section 3.4.2). 3.1. Interpolation of geometry The interpolation of the shell geometry is easily accomplished using the isoparametric procedure [1]. The 2D chart ~ of the discretized domain is given by / ~ sÃ Â¼ /Ã°r;

where E and m are YoungÃs modulus and PoissonÃs ratio for the material. Let us now consider a shell structure with zero displacements on a suï¬ciently large area of the boundary and zero applied traction on the rest of the boundary. Using Eqs. (20)â(24), the governing variational equation for the basic shell mathematical model is: ~ Find the unknown displacement U satisfying the prescribed boundary displacements such that

see Ref. [1], and the director vector is frequently calculated by averaging the midsurface normal vectors ~3 of a the elements sharing node i. For the continuum mechanics based shell ï¬nite ele~ ment, the director vector in the element V n is interpolated from the nodal director vectors, see Fig. 3, and the element stiï¬ness matrices can then directly be calculated [1]. To develop the shell ï¬nite element based on the basic shell mathematical model, we need to decide how to establish ~3 . In our implementation, we calculate ~3 a a to be a unit normal vector to the element interpolated midsurface. At the nodes, however, the same nodal director vectors are used as for the continuum mechanics based shell ï¬nite elements, but merely to be able to introduce the nodal rotations as given in Eq. (49), see Fig. 3(c). These assumptions of course introduce a diï¬erence in the formulations and hence diï¬erences in the computed analysis results. But the diï¬erences in analysis results can be expected to be small for smooth shell midsurfaces (those we consider, see Sections 3.4 and 4).

The above expressions can now directly be used to evaluate the strain components in Eq. (20). Note that, alternatively, we could also directly interpolate the covariant components in Eq. (37) u1 Â¼

where the ui1 ; ui2 and ui3 are the covariant components of the translational displacement vector at the node i, and the hi1 and hi2 are the covariant components of the rotation vector at the node i. In this case, it is not necessary to use the transformation mentioned above but care must then be exercised that for any geometric form and size of shell element the rigid body mode criterion is still fulï¬lled. This point is exempliï¬ed in Appendix A. A formulation that does not satisfy the rigid body mode criterion cannot be recommended for general use [1].

3.3. Strain-displacement and stiï¬ness matrices The ï¬nal step in the element formulation is to construct the strain-displacement and stiï¬ness matrices. The covariant strain-displacement matrix corresponding to the 3D contravariant basis, deï¬ned in Eq. (16), is immediately obtained from Eq. (20) in terms of the nodal displacements and rotations. For the numerical implementation, it is somewhat involved to use the constitutive relationship in Eq. (22). A more eï¬ective way is to obtain the 3D strain components

in the global Cartesian coordinate system and employ the usual 3D constitutive relationship with the plane stress assumption imposed as shown, for example, in Ref. [1]. The stiï¬ness matrices of the shell ï¬nite elements based on the basic shell mathematical model are then calculated as the stiï¬ness matrices of the continuum mechanics based shell ï¬nite elements. These considerations and conclusions, as those in Section 3.2, are also applicable to the MITC shell elements because of the speciï¬c formulation of these elements, see Refs. [1,2,14]. The good convergence

properties of these elements have been studied, for example, in Refs. [14,16,26]. 3.4. Numerical comparisons To this point, we reviewed the basic shell mathematical model and presented how to formulate a shell ï¬nite element discretization based on this model. As we pointed out, small diï¬erences must be expected in the solutions compared to those obtained with the continuum mechan-

ics based shell ï¬nite elements, because of the assumptions ~ used regarding V n and ~3 in each of the elements, see Fig. a 3. If, however, for the two formulations, the same element nodal points and the same interpolated element midsur~ faces are used, and ~3 is equal to V n , for every point in a the corresponding elements, then the same element stiï¬ness matrices are obtained. A trivial such case is the analysis of a plate. But also, we must expect that in the analysis of a smooth shell, this condition is always reached as the mesh is reï¬ned.

In this section we demonstrate numerically by means of some examples that indeed even when using relatively coarse meshes, this diï¬erence is very small and that therefore the formulations are equivalent. Note that in these example solutions we do not measure the accuracy of the response predicted (compared to an exact or highly accurate solution) but only the diï¬erence in the response predicted using the two formulations. We also show in this section that it is important to interpolate the displacements as discussed in Section 3.2 (i.e. the rigid body mode criterion must be satisï¬ed). 3.4.1. Cylindrical shell problems We consider the well known cylindrical shell problems described in Fig. 4. The shell has uniform thickness t, length 2L and radius R and is subjected to the pressure distribution p(h) normal to the shell surface pÃ°hÃ Â¼ p0 cosÃ°2hÃ: Ã°53Ã

Depending on whether both ends are clamped or free, the asymptotic behavior of the structure is membrane dominated or bending dominated, respectively. By symmetry, the analyses are performed using one eighth of the structure, the shaded region ABCD in Fig. 4. The detailed description of the shell problems is presented in Refs. [12,14]. Using the continuum mechanics based shell ï¬nite element and the shell ï¬nite element based on the basic shell mathematical model, we compare the strain energy difference of the solutions obtained using the displacement based 6-node elements for both the membrane dominated and bending dominated shell problems as the element size h decreases. To investigate the dependence of the diï¬erence on the shell thickness, we consider the cases t/L = 1/100, t/L = 1/1000 and t/L = 1/10 000. The diï¬erence is calculated by jDEj jEC Ã EB j Â¼ ; EC EC Ã°54Ã

where EC and EB denote the strain energies of the solutions obtained with the continuum mechanics based shell ï¬nite element and the shell ï¬nite element based on the basic shell mathematical model, respectively. Fig. 5(a) and (b) report that for the clamped and free cases the strain energy diï¬erences between the solutions obtained using the two shell ï¬nite elements quickly vanish independent of the shell thickness as the element size decreases. Note that, when the element size is as large as L/2 (h = 0.5, that is, a 2 Â· 2 mesh is used.), the energy diï¬erence is already less than 0.1% and 0.3% for the clamped and free cases, respectively. We perform similar numerical tests for the shell ï¬nite element based on the basic shell mathematical model using the displacement interpolation in Eqs. (51) and (52). Fig. 6(a) and (b) shows that, when we use the displacement interpolation in Eqs. (51) and (52), as exempliï¬ed in the Appendix A, the results using the shell ï¬nite element based on the basic shell mathematical model are very diï¬erent to the results using the continuum mechanics based shell ï¬nite element for the free case and small shell thickness. Actually, the calculated strain energy is much too large. This is due to the fact that rigid body motions are not contained in the element formulation (see Appendix A). The need to be able to represent the rigid body modes is strikingly important in the case of the free cylinder and small shell thickness. 3.4.2. Partly clamped hyperbolic paraboloid shell problem The partly clamped hyperbolic paraboloid shell problem shown in Fig. 7 is a good bending dominated benchmark problem to test a formulation for locking, see Refs. [2,5,14]. The shell surface is deï¬ned by h 1 1 i2 z Â¼ x2 Ã y 2 ; Ã°x; yÃ 2 Ã ; Ã°55Ã 2 2 and clamped along the side x = Ã1/2. The structure is loaded by its self-weight (qgt = 80 per unit surface area). By symmetry, we can limit calculations to the shaded region ABCD in Fig. 7 with clamped boundary conditions along BC and symmetry

conditions along AB. The detailed solution results and an asymptotic analysis are given in Refs. [5,14]. Using Eq. (54), we calculate the strain energy diï¬erence between the solutions obtained using the MITC9 continuum mechanics based shell ï¬nite element and the MITC9 shell ï¬nite element based on the basic shell mathematical model (for the MITC9 shell element see Ref. [26]). Fig. 8 displays the rapidly decreasing diï¬erence between the two shell ï¬nite element solutions as the element size decreases.

4. Detailed study of shell ï¬nite element discretizations As discussed above, the shell ï¬nite elements based on the basic shell mathematical model are equivalent to the continuum mechanics based shell ï¬nite elements. We next use the shell ï¬nite elements based on the basic shell mathematical model to perform a detailed study of the strain components in ï¬nite element discretizations as obtained using either discretization approach as the shell thickness decreases.

A bending dominated problem is obtained when both ends are free and a membrane dominated problem is obtained when the ends are clamped. However, we consider here only the bending dominated case, in which membrane and shear locking can occur. By symmetry, the shaded region ABCD shown in Fig. 9 is used for the calculations. This is a diï¬cult bending dominated problem to solve when the thickness is small, but the problem is a good test case because of the negative Gaussian curvature of the shell surface, see Refs. [12,26]. The objective of this detailed study is to identify some of the diï¬culties that arise in the ï¬nite element solution of this shell problem. We consider two thickness ratios, namely t/L = 1/100 and t/L = 1/1000, which are common thickness ratios encountered in engineering practice. All parts of the

strain components in Eqs. (20) and (21) of the basic shell mathematical model are considered. We should note that, although the strain components and their parts in Eqs. (20) and (21) are covariant components in the curvilinear coordinate system, the strain distributions plotted in all ï¬gures correspond to the local Cartesian shell-aligned coordinate system [1] and at the outer surface (n3 = t/2) of the hyperboloid shell. The plotted strains are also unsmoothed [1]. The relationship between the strains in the diï¬erent coordinate systems is eab Ã°~a â¬ ~b Ã Â¼ â¬kl Ã°~k â¬~l Ã; g g e e g g e e ea3 Ã°~a â¬ ~3 Ã Â¼ â¬b3 Ã°~b â¬~3 Ã; Ã°58Ã

Detailed strain analysis using the MITC9 shell element The free hyperboloid shell problem was solved using a uniform 64 Â· 64 mesh of the MITC9 shell element (of course, based on the basic shell mathematical model).

This solution is deemed accurate [26] and provides reference strain distributions. Figs. 10â13 and 14â17 show the reference strain distributions when t/L is 1/100 and 1/1000. These ï¬gures not only show the total strain components but also individual parts. It is important to see that, as the shell thickness decreases, there is an increasing diï¬erence in the orders of magnitudes between the membrane strain and its two parts, see Figs. 11 and 15. These ï¬gures show that both parts of the membrane strain are of opposite sign and in absolute values about three

and ï¬ve orders of magnitudes larger than the total membrane strain itself. A similar phenomenon is seen for the transverse shear strains and their individual parts, see Figs. 10(b), 13(b) and (c), 14(b) and 17(b) and (c). Table 1 summarizes the orders of the strain magnitudes in the reference solutions when the thickness ratios are 1/10, 1/100 and 1/1000. The order of the membrane strain is 10 times smaller than of its parts when t/ L = 1/10 but 105 times smaller when t/L = 1/1000. The same ratios also hold for the orders of the transverse shear strains.

In a numerical solution, it is diï¬cult to calculate accurately a small value by summing two very large values and, as the two values grow, the diï¬culty increases. Clearly, this diï¬culty can be a major source of errors in the numerical solution of the shell problem. Indeed, as the shell thickness decreases, the increasing diï¬erence in the orders of the magnitudes between the membrane strain and its two parts can be a source of membrane locking and the increasing diï¬erence in the orders of the magnitudes between the transverse shear strain and its two parts can be a source of shear locking. 4.2. Detailed strain analysis using the MITC6 shell element In the previous section, we identiï¬ed why the free hyperboloid shell problem is diï¬cult to solve accurately. We next perform the same analysis as in the previous section using a uniform 24 Â· 24 mesh of the MITC6 [12] triangular shell ï¬nite elements based on the basic shell mathematical model. Ref. [12] reports that for the free hyperboloid shell problem the 6-node element shows some locking when the shell thickness is very small. As in Section 4.1, two cases of thickness, t/L = 1/100 and t/L = 1/1000, are considered. We show only the

membrane and transverse shear strains and their parts because these were recognized as diï¬cult to solve for. Indeed, the other strain components are accurately predicted in this solution. Figs. 18 and 19 display the distributions of the strain components of the free hyperboloid shell problem when t/L is 1/100. In this case, the solutions of the membrane and transverse shear strains are reasonably smooth but (except for the strain component â¬12) less smooth than their parts. The magnitudes of the solutions except for the transverse shear strain â¬13 (with predicted values however still reasonably small) are quite well predicted compared with the reference solutions. Figs. 20 and 21 show the solutions when t/L is 1/1000. It is interesting to note that the distributions of the membrane and transverse shear strains are not smooth and the magnitudes of the solutions are not accurate although their parts (except for the strain component â¬12) are quite well approximated. This numerical example using the MITC6 shell ï¬nite element demonstrates how the diï¬culty of calculating the strain components with large individual parts aï¬ects the ï¬nite element solution in the free hyperboloid shell problem. Clearly, the phenomenon we see is some membrane and shear locking.

5. Conclusions The objective of this paper was to obtain new insight into the ï¬nite element discretization and solution of shell structures. For this purpose, we used the basic shell mathematical model to formulate shell ï¬nite elements that are equivalent to the widely-used continuum mechanics based shell ï¬nite elements, including the MITC elements. We showed that when ï¬nite elements are formulated based on a shell theory, it is important to ensure that the rigid body modes can be represented. If the interpolations used do not exactly admit rigid body modes, large errors can be present in the solution, in particular, if the shell is thin and a bending dominated condition is analyzed. Considering shell analysis, it is well known that large diï¬erences in magnitudes of the strain terms and their parts can arise. We highlighted this fact in this paper and presented the analysis of a shell structure for which the membrane and shear strain components contain parts of large magnitudes. These individual parts are orders of magnitudes larger than the actual strain components and these orders of magnitude diï¬erences quickly increase as a shell thickness decreases. Since each of the parts is calculated from diï¬erent displacement and rotation derivatives in the ï¬nite element solution, clearly difï¬culties in the development of eï¬ective shell elements must be anticipated and these relate to the well-known locking phenomena. While we concentrated here on the usually used ï¬ve degrees-of-freedom per node continuum mechanics based shell elements, these observations are, of course, also applicable when considering 3D shell elements and their underlying mathematical model [27]. The insight provided in this study should help to improve the mixed interpolation of strain components, or develop interpolations for their individual parts, in order to arrive at improved shell analysis capabilities.

^ body modes. If we set all ui1 equal to a constant value, the corresponding physical axial strain should be zero. This condition is obviously satisï¬ed using the interpolation in Eq. (A.3) but not in general using Eq. (A.5). We do not use an element which cannot represent the rigid body modes exactly. In case the rigid body modes cannot be represented, strain energy is stored in the element under rigid body motions. Such an element will in particular capture non-physical strain energy in bending dominated problems (see Fig. 6(b)) and in large displacement analysis. References
