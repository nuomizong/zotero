We present in this paper a shell element that models the three-dimensional (3D) effects of surface tractions, like needed when a shell is conï¬ned between other solid media. The element is the widely used MITC4 shell element enriched by the use of a fully 3D stressâstrain description, appropriate throughthe-thickness displacements to model surface tractions, and pressure degrees of freedom for incompressible analyses. The element formulation avoids instabilities and ill-conditioning. Various example solutions are presented to illustrate the capabilities of the element. Ã 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction The ï¬nite element analysis of shells has now matured to the extent that it sometimes seems any complex shell can be accurately analyzed. In fact, however, there are still a number of outstanding difï¬culties. These relate to the more accurate modeling of shell structures to include 3D effects, the development of still more effective shell ï¬nite elements, in particular triangular elements, and the mathematical analyses to ensure optimality of the ï¬nite element solutions [1,2]. To a large extent, shell structures are now solved in practice using 4-node shell elements. Among those available, the MITC4 shell element is probably the most effective element, in particular when linear and nonlinear analyses are to be performed [1â6]. However, the other MITC shell elements can be more effective for speciï¬c analyses [5,7â9]. The formulation of the MITC4 shell element is based on the ReissnerâMindlin assumptions of ââmaterial ï¬bers originally straight and normal to the shell mid-surface do not stretch and remain straightâ and ââzero stress normal to the shell mid-surfaceâ [1,2]. The MITC elements can be formulated using a continuum representation or the âbasic shell modelâ identiï¬ed by Chapelle and Bathe [1,2,10,11]. While the ReissnerâMindlin assumptions are widely applicable, they cannot model the application of shell surface stresses as needed in the analysis of a shell conï¬ned between solid media. For example, in metal forming, the normal

and shear tractions applied to thin sheet surfaces can be large and the accurate modeling of normal stresses and shear stresses can be important. Of course, in addition, large strain elasticâplastic (almost incompressible) conditions need be represented. To model the effects of surface tractions, it appears that 3D shell-solid elements are most appropriate, see [12â16] and the references therein. In the formulation of these elements, the top and bottom surfaces of the shell are represented geometrically and their positions are updated through the displacement degrees of freedom, just like in a fully 3D analysis of solids but with only one element layer through the shell thickness [1,2]. Since the bending strains vary linearly, clearly, for consistency with bending theory including the Poisson ratio coupling, the through-the-thickness normal strain must also be allowed to vary linearly. This requires a quadratic interpolation of displacements through the shell thickness. The shear, membrane and pinching locking can be relieved using MITC strain interpolations. While sometimes effective, these elements display severe illconditioning when the shell becomes thin and when the shell is an (almost) incompressible medium [17,18]. To improve the element behavior and computational effectiveness, instead of displacement degrees of freedom, enhanced strains have been used, see for example Refs. [12,19,20], and the references therein. However, enhanced strain formulations can be unstable, see Refs. [21,22], and are therefore best avoided. Hence, a more effective approach is to build on the basic MITC4 shell element, for which all shell actions are represented using the shell mid-surface, use the three-dimensional stressâstrain description, and enrich the shell

element formulation âjudiciouslyâ by appropriate displacement and pressure interpolations. These interpolations need to be selected to not introduce instabilities or ill-conditioning. This approach was used in Ref. [23] to enrich the MITC4 shell element by two element degrees of freedom corresponding to thickness stretching (a constant and a linear term) in order to represent large strain effects. The objective in this paper is to present the MITC4 shell element enriched by the 3D stressâstrain law, and by displacements and pressure used to represent accurately the effects of shell surface normal and tangential tractions, and incompressible conditions. The enrichment in displacements is achieved by simply adding displacement interpolations with corresponding degrees of freedom at the four nodes. The resulting displacements are compatible across element boundaries. To render the element also applicable to (almost) incompressible conditions, the u/p formulation with an assumption on the pressure is used [1]. All these degrees of freedom, including the pressure degrees of freedom, can be invoked hierarchically as desired. This hierarchical feature of the element is very attractive, obviously from a modeling point of view, but also from a practical point of view. Namely, the pre- and post-processing capabilities of the classical MITC4 element are directly applicable by simply increasing the number of degrees of freedom allowed for the element. The element presented in this paper is largely based on concepts previously published but in this paper we have synthesized various ideas in an aim to obtain an overall effective formulation. In particular, this 3D-shell element formulation does not show ill-conditioning. In the following sections, we ï¬rst present the formulation of the continuum shell model, then the ï¬nite element

The shell model In this section, we present the shell model that we will solve by our ï¬nite element discretization. We follow the notation used in Ref. [1].

where n is the natural coordinate in the thickness direction, 0xM is the position vector of material particles in the shell mid-surface, 0 a is the thickness and 0Vn is the director vector. In the deformed conï¬guration, an initially straight ï¬ber may be curved with the assumption shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The assumed deformed geometry at time t is

originally normal to the mid-surface can strain linearly and become curved, and the transverse shear stresses have a quadratic distribution through the shell thickness. This enables the element to precisely capture the effect of surface tractions, like normal and frictional forces, applied on the top and bottom shell surfaces. Note that 0a, the initial thickness, is employed in front of each higher order function. This is a scaling factor in order to avoid illconditioning of the global stiffness matrix as the thickness becomes small. It is more natural to use the current thickness but we use the initial thickness because this leads to a simpler formulation. In the same way, the deformed geometry at time t + Dt is deï¬ned by

For the shell element, two rotational degrees of freedom have been generally used to describe the rotation of a director vector.

The current shell model contains 12 parameters to describe the shell behavior: three translations, three rotations, one thickness change, three quadratic displacements and two cubic displacements. However, we now exclude the c rotation effect in the above equations because the degree of freedom leads to spurious zero energy modes, even when the initially straight ï¬ber transverse to the shell mid-surface has become curved. Consider the linear terms of the incremental displacements, uL , as arranged in Table 1. We see that the displacement corresponding to the c rotation when a ï¬ber is not straight can be described by the degrees of freedom q1, q2, c1, c2. Therefore, the c rotation is a redundant degree of freedom and can be set to zero when we use the higher-order in-plane displacements.

Here the superscript AS denotes assumed strain and the superscript DI emphasizes that strains are evaluated from the displacement interpolation using Eq. (15). While the basic MITC4 element does not show membrane locking, the in-plane membrane behavior can of course be improved by introducing incompatible displacement modes [1], as offered for example in ADINA [24]. A similar improvement in the membrane behavior must be expected when using incompatible displacement modes in the formulation of the enriched element presented here. However, the strain assumptions normal to the shell mid-surface used here mean that the element will show pinching locking.

This behavior can be alleviated using the MITC approach applied to the normal strain [12,25,26]. To fulï¬ll the condition that the normal strain be zero throughout the element when this strain is zero at the element nodes, we simply interpolate the normal strain bilinearly over the element using the nodal values directly calculated from the displacement assumptions. These nodal values will be zero for a constant bending situation even when the nodal director vectors are not normal to the shell mid-surface described by txM. Therefore, the assumed transverse normal strain is described by

3.3. Displacement/pressure (u/p) formulation Unlike shell elements based on the plane stress assumption, shell elements using the full three-dimensional constitutive law suffer also from volumetric locking in incompressible, (or almost incompressible) analysis, just like the elements used in the analysis of solids [1]. The mixed formulation known as the displacement/pressure (u/ p) formulation has been proven to be effective for the analysis of incompressible conditions [1,27]. Therefore, we adopt this formulation for the three-dimensional shell element. The key step of using the u/p formulation is to determine the interpolation of the assumed independent pressure ï¬eld. In the 4/1 plane strain element, the pressure ï¬eld is assumed to be constant which means that strictly the element does not pass the infâsup condition [1,28]. This is observed when regular meshes and special boundary conditions are used [1]. However, in practice, hardly ï¬at and non-

to each element and these can be statically condensed out prior to the assemblage of the element stiffness matrix. Since the 4/1 ï¬at plane strain element (four nodes for displacements and a constant pressure) does not satisfy the infâsup condition for incompressible analysis, there are very special element conï¬gurations and boundary conditions in which the shell element will also show checkerboard pressures. However, as mentioned already above, these will hardly be encountered in practice, and, also, can be identiï¬ed in the post-processing of the results by plotting the pressure bands [1,31]. A 4-node plane strain element that satisï¬es the infâsup condition is presented in Refs. [32,33]. The interpolation used in these references could be employed for the shell element but uses enhanced strains and would render the shell element in computations considerably more expensive. 4. Numerical studies In this section, we illustrate some important features of our shell element through the results of several test problems. We

Note that the pressure is assumed to be constant on each plane given by a ï¬xed value of n and vary linearly through the shell thickness. The linear pressure distribution is introduced considering bending. The cost increase by using this formulation is negligible since only two additional pressure degrees of freedom are added

using L = 20.0, t = 1.0, q = 10.0, E = 1.0 Ã 105, v = 0.3. The beam is meshed with 41 elements along its length. We report the stresses as evaluated along the vertical centerline of the element located at the center of the beam, where edge effects are negligible. The analytical values for the stresses are derived in the Appendix. In the ï¬rst load case, the resultant axial force and shear force are zero but the bending moment is nonzero. As shown in Fig. 3, all shell element solutions give the same correct axial stress distribution. However, only the 11-DOF shell element predicts the correct shear stress distribution satisfying the zero resultant shear force condition and the traction boundary conditions on the top and bottom surfaces, sxzjn = Â±1 = q. In the second load case, the resultant shear force and bending moment are zero, but the axial force is nonzero. Fig. 4 shows the calculated stress distributions. In this case, both, the 9-DOF shell element and the 11-DOF shell element give the analytical solutions because the cubic displacement function has no effect on the ï¬nite element solution.

In the third load case, the resultant axial force and bending moment are nonzero, but the resultant shear force is zero. Fig. 5 gives the calculated results. The predicted transverse shear stress is quite different using the various element assumptions. Only the 11-DOF shell element gives an accurate solution satisfying the traction boundary conditions on the top and bottom surfaces, sxzjn=1=q, sxzjn = Ã1 = 0. This result must be expected, since the case is a linear superposition of cases 1 and 2. Here, in general, the 11-DOF shell element with the quadratic distribution of the transverse shear stress through its thickness must be used to accurately capture the effect of tangential tractions on the top and bottom shell surfaces (satisfying the traction boundary conditions). 4.2. Pressurized cylinder We consider the pressurized cylinder problem shown in Fig. 6. We use this problem to test the predictive capabilities

of our shell element in the analysis of a thick-walled structure. A one element model is used, see Fig. 6b. Note that, since the cylinder can only expand or contract in the radial direction due to symmetry, the degrees of freedom for the in-plane quadratic and cubic displacement functions (q1, q2, c1, and c2) have no effect in the solution of this problem, i.e. the 9-DOF and 11-DOF shell elements will give the same result as the 7-DOF element.

Table 4 lists the predicted radial displacement of the cylinder mid-surface, and shows that the displacement obtained using the 7-DOF shell element is in good agreement with the analytical solution, even when the cylinder is rather thick. However, in the (almost) incompressible case, the 7-DOF shell element needs to be used with the proposed assumed pressure ï¬eld. Of course, if the cylinder is thin, both, the 5-DOF and 7-DOF shell elements give virtually the same result for the mid-surface displacement. Figs. 7 and

8 show the predicted radial and hoop stresses for the thin and thick cases.

4.3. Test case for conditioning of the stiffness matrix In these problem solutions, we study the conditioning of the stiffness matrices when the thickness of the shell decreases and

results in both the membrane and bending dominated cases. However, when the material is nearly incompressible (see Tables 7 and 9), the shell elements based on the full three-dimensional constitutive law experience volumetric locking while the 5-DOF MITC4 shell element of course does not lock. Note that, by using the u/p formulation, the volumetric locking of the shell elements using the three dimensional constitutive law is successfully removed in, both, the membrane and bending dominated cases. 4.5. A quadrant of a cantilevered cylinder under in-plane tangential tractions A quadrant of a cantilevered cylinder under in-plane tangential tractions is tested. The tractions are applied in the longitudinal direction for one case and the circumferential direction for the other case as depicted in Fig. 14. In order to see how the load positions affect the solutions, the deformation-dependent tractions are applied on the top, middle and bottom surfaces for each case.

First, a single element with two different orientations of director vectors as shown in Fig. 9 is tested. The results are listed in Table 5. We see that the condition number of the 3D-shell element with more than ï¬ve degrees of freedom is for the thin case only about an order of magnitude larger than for the MITC4 shell element with ï¬ve degrees of freedom. This increase in the condition number is small when compared to the increase for the 3D solid element. Note that condÃ°KÃ $ OÃ°t Ã2 Ã for all shell elements while condÃ°KÃ $ OÃ°t Ã4 Ã for the 3D solid element with the thickness, t. When the director vectors are not normal to the shell mid-surface as shown in Fig. 9b, the condition number only slightly increases. This is shown in Fig. 10. Next, we consider a plate modeled with a 10 Ã 10 element mesh, see Fig. 11, and solve for the eigenvalues and condition numbers, see Ref. [17] for a similar example. We see that the condition numbers of our shell element with 7â11 degrees of freedom are only slightly larger than for the MITC4 element. Therefore, in the analysis of shell structures in which 3D effects shall be predicted, the element proposed here is much more reliable than the 3D solid element. Finally, the single element with an almost incompressible material is considered. In this case, we have inevitably an ill-conditioned stiffness matrix because, for 3D type elements, we have at least one very large eigenvalue corresponding to the volumetric deformation mode. In Fig. 12, the displacement-based (without pressure degrees of freedom) shell element shows eight very large eigenvalues that cause the element to be too stiff and lock, see Tables 4, 7 and 9. If we use the element with the u/p formulation, see the assumed pressure ï¬eld in Eq. (21), only two very large eigenvalues which correspond to the volumetric expansion mode (the constant pressure mode) and a bending mode (the linear pressure mode through the thickness) are observed. It appears natural to therefore try to use only the constant pressure ï¬eld (p = p0) in the u/p formulation, but then the element has a spurious zero energy mode corresponding to the bending mode. Hence, the pressure assumption in Eq. (21) is more appropriate. 4.4. Hyperboloid shell problems These shell problems were proposed and studied by Chapelle and Bathe [2,29,30] and provide excellent test problems for shell elements. We solve the problems here to investigate the performance of our shell discretizations in the almost incompressible case. The geometry of the shell mid-surface is given by (see Fig. 13)

If the shell is clamped on both ends, the problem is a membranedominated problem, and if the shell is free on both ends, the problem is a bending-dominated problem. We use a 16 Ã 16 uniform mesh of elements to solve the two problems. Some results are listed in Tables 6â9. When the material is compressible (see Tables 6 and 8), each shell model gives similar

Geometrically nonlinear analyses are performed using the 11-DOF shell element with a 10 Ã 9 mesh of elements in the total Lagrangian framework [1]. The deformed shapes and the displacements and effective stresses are given in Figs. 15â20. We can see that signiï¬cant response differences arise depending on how the tractions are applied. Note that we may obtain very similar results with the 5-DOF MITC4 shell element by applying the resultant forces and moments

on the shell mid-surface, especially for a very thin structure as in this problem. Here the effect of the quadratic and cubic in-plane displacements is small enough to be neglected. However, our 11DOF shell element provides a direct and natural way to include the effects of surface tractions when these are initially unknown (e.g. imposed in a metal forming problem), vary over the shell top and bottom surfaces and the shell thickness changes signiï¬cantly.

5. Concluding remarks We presented in this paper a 4-node 3D-shell element that, in essence, represents a hierarchical improvement of the MITC4 shell element to include some important three-dimensional effects: the full 3D stressâstrain law is used, the thickness change is included, shell tractions can be applied on the top and bottom surfaces of the shell, and the material can be incompressible. An important attribute is that the element does not result in undue ill-conditioning (as seen when shell surface top and bottom nodes are used in the kinematic description of 3D-shell elements) and does not result in instabilities (as seen with enhanced strain formulations). There are various ï¬elds of applications for the 3D-shell element, including all those involving large strain effects and contact. But in particular, the given formulation provides the basic framework for effective large strain analyses using 3D orthotropic hyperelastic or elasticâplastic material descriptions [34â37] as encountered in bio-engineering and metal forming. A quite outstanding research task is the mathematical analysis of the proposed 3D-shell element, as pursued in Refs. [2,6,10,16,18] for other formulations. Appendix We consider the cantilever beam subjected to in-plane tractions described in Table 3, and use the Airy stress function method to solve for the stresses. The stress equilibrium and strain compatibility conditions are satisï¬ed by solving the equation:
