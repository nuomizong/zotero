Additive Manufacturing Encompasses Many Different Technologies

Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)
• Filament is made of thermoplastic materials
– e..g., ABS, polycarbonate, PLA

• Temporary support structure can be made from water-soluble material such as PVA
– removed using heated sodium hydroxide solution

Stereolithography (SLA)
• SLA uses liquid ultraviolet curable photopolymer resin • Laser beam traces one layer on the surface of the resin • Laser light cures and solidifies the layer • The platform descends by one layer
Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/

Photopolymers
• Change from a liquid state to solid state when exposed with light of a certain wavelength

• Typical ingredients:
– Monomers: small molecules, lower viscosity – Oligomers: relatively high molecular weight, Acrylates,
epoxies, etc.

– Photoinitiators: generate reactive species (free radicals, irons) under light exposure to initiate the polymerziation – Additives: binders, surfactants, stabilizers, etc.

How Photopolymers Work
• Free Radical Polymerization
– Initiation: Free radicals are generated through the initiator when exposed to light – Propagation: Free radicals react with monomer molecules to generate new reactive center, monomers react with reactive center repetitively to grow into a long chain – Termination: Chain termination occurs when two reactive centers come close and react with each other to yield complete macromolecules

Stereolithography Process

Digital Light Projector (DLP) 3D Printing
• DLP 3D printer uses liquid ultraviolet curable photopolymer resin • DLP exposes and solidifies one layer at a time on the surface of the resin • The Z-axis moves by one layer

DLP 3D Printing Features
• Simple design
– laser+mirror are replaced by a projector – only one degree of freedom

• Faster than SLA
– exposes one layer at a time

• Materials
– The same as SLA

• No additional support material
– Lattice structure similar to SLA

DLP 3D Printing Process

Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS)
• SLS and DMLS use a bed of small particles (made of plastic, metal, ceramic, or glass) • High-power laser traces one layer on the surface of the powder bed melting/fusing the particles • The platform descends by one layer and more material is added

Plaster-based 3D Printing
• This method uses a bed of small plaster particles • Inkjet printhead prints with liquid (possibly colored) adhesive one layer on the surface of the powder bed fusing the particles • The platform descends by one layer and more material is added
Source: Zhou and Lu, 2011

Plaster-based 3D Printing Features
• Similar to SLS and DMLS
– Also uses granular materials – Uses inkjet printhead instead of laser – Glues particles instead of melting them

• Does not require support structure
– Overhangs are supported by powder material

• The only technology supporting full-color printing • Materials
– Plaster only – Color can be applied (typically on/near the surface)

Thermal Phase Change Inkjets
• Inkjet printhead jets heated liquid plastic and support material (wax) • Material droplets solidify as they cool down • Excess material is removed using a milling head to make a uniform thickness layer • Particles are vacuumed away • The platform descends by one layer

Thermal Phase Change Inkjets Features
• Extremely high resolution • Slow printing time • Materials
– Limited: plastics and waxes

• Support material
– Wax: easy to remove

• Manufactured objects are used as casting pattern but almost never as final functional parts

Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM)
• Sheet is adhered to a substrate with a heated roller • Laser traces desired dimensions of prototype • Laser cross hatches non-part area to facilitate waste removal • Platform with completed layer moves down out of the way • Fresh sheet of material is rolled into position • Platform moves up into position to receive next layer

Model Orientation: Build Time

Algorithms for Specifying Model Orientation
• Manual placement
– User is responsible for placing parts on the build tray

• Semi-automated placement
– User places parts on the build tray – System provides feedback on build time, support volume, support contact area, mechanical properties

• Automated placement
– orientation is computed using optimization according to one or more objectives (build time, support volume, support area, mechanical properties)

Support Structure Generation
• Do not require special support
– SLS, DMLS, LOM, Plaster-based • Require support
• SLA, DLP, FDM, phase-change inkjet

• Different goals
– – – – – – Prevent curling as the resin hardens Supporting overhangs Maintaining stability (part does not move, tip over) Supporting large flat walls Preventing excessive shrinkage Supporting slanted walls

Support Structure Generation Depends on Manufacturing Method
• Different for FDM, SLA/DLP, inkjet printing

FDM

Simple Conservative Algorithm
• Use ray casting in the z direction to compute all intersections for a ray • Sort intersections in the increasing z to determine intervals inside/outside of the object • Any outside intervals before the last inside interval should contain support

Support Generation For FDM
• FDM printers can print at some draft angle

Huang et al. 2009

3D Printing Software Pipeline
Input Model Orientation and Positioning Support Structures Slicing Path Planning Machine Instructions

What Does Path Planning Influence?
• Build time
– repositioning the tool at the start of a new path – accelerating and decelerating for direction changes

• Surface accuracy
– the filament size

• Distortion
– materials with a high coefficient of thermal expansion – the top layer shrinks when it hardens and it distorts since it is tied to the bottom layer

•

Stiffness and strength
– fill pattern – the area and strength of bonds depends on spacing and the time interval between the tool traversal

Path Planning for Raster-based 3D Printing
• Superimpose a voxel grid and test whether a voxel is inside/outside the model • Trivial for DLP 3D printing • For inkjet-based 3D printing requires computing print head movement (many nozzles, distances between nozzles)

Path Planning for Vector-based 3D Printing
• Contour • Contour + solid interior • Contour + interior fill pattern

Path Planning for Vector-based 3D Printing: Contour
• Allows manufacturing hollow objects, some overhangs, some tilted surfaces • Reduces frequency of tool repositioning • Reduces support structures
Source: http://www.3ders.org

Path Planning for Vector-based 3D Printing: Contour
• Offset inwards by distance equal to the filament radius

no offset

offset inwards

Path Planning for Vector-based 3D Printing: Interior
• Tracing contours is combined with filling the interior • The interior can be completely filled

Horton et al 1993 Han et al 2002

Path Planning for Vector-based 3D Printing: Interior
• Tracing contours is combined with filling the interior • Many different fill patterns can be used
