Based on the higher-order global–local theories, a ﬁnite element model is proposed to study the bending behavior of stiffened laminated plates. The proposed model treats the embedded stiffeners as the part of laminated plate, so that the compatibility of displacements and stresses between the plate and the stiffeners can be automatically satisﬁed. Distributions of the displacements and stresses through the thickness of laminates were also given for the ﬁrst time, which can serve as references for future investigations as such information is lacking in the published literature. In addition, the impact of the stiffeners on the bending response of the stiffened laminated plates is also studied in terms of the quantity, the collocation and the geometry of stiffeners. Numerical results showed that the higher-order global–local theories are more suitable for predicting the bending response of thick and moderately thick stiffened laminated plates compared to the ﬁrst order theory commonly used in engineering. By varying the quantity, the collocation and the geometry of stiffeners, the stiffness and the strength of stiffened laminated plates can be remarkably improved. Ó 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

1. Introduction Stiffeners are often used in plates to increase the strength and stiffness. Such structures are usually called as the stiffened laminated plates, which have improved strength-to-weight ratio and are cost-effective. As a result, the stiffened laminated plates as thin-walled structures become more and more popular in various applications, such as aerospace, marine and other industrial structures. However, due to their complex structures, the analytical models of the stiffened laminated plates may lead to very tedious work. Therefore, many researchers used the numerical methods as alternative approach to study the stiffened laminated plates. Based on the classical plate theory where the effect of transverse shear deformation is neglected, Barik and Mukhopadhyay [1] proposed a stiffened plate element for the static, the free vibration stability analysis of arbitrary stiffened plates. For medium-thick laminated plates, transverse shear deformation shall be considered due to their high in-plane modulus-to-transverse shear modulus ratio. Based on the ﬁrst order shear deformation theory, several ﬁnite element models have been developed, such as a model for predicting the global behavior of the stiffened laminated plates by Kolli and Chandrashekhara [2]; a model for buckling and vibration

analysis of stiffened laminated composite shell structures by Rikards et al. [3]; a model for studying the static and dynamic behavior of composite cylindrical panels [6], and a stiffened plate model for bending and stability analysis of stiffened laminated plates [4]. The stiffened plate element was further used to predict the transverse displacements and natural frequencies of the stiffened laminated plates [5]. Other stiffened plate elements based on the ﬁrst order theories can be found in references [7–11]. In the ﬁrst order shear deformation theory, transverse shear strain along the thickness direction is assumed to be constant. Therefore, the shear correction factors must be used to adjust the transverse shear stiffeners. The above ﬁnite element models only considered the global responses (deﬂections, natural frequencies and critical loads), while the local responses (in-plane and transverse stress distributions along the thickness direction) were not studied. In addition, the ﬁnite strip method was also used in the free vibration and the buckling analysis of stiffened laminated plates [12–14]. To avoid using the shear correction factors, Biswal and Ghosh [15] proposed a four-node rectangular element on the basis of the higher order theory for the bending analysis of stiffened laminated plates. Ghosh and Biswal [16] further studied the dynamic response of stiffened laminated plates using a model which can satisfy the condition of zero transverse shear stresses on the upper and lower surfaces. Sadek and Tawﬁk [17] proposed a higher-order stiffened plate element to predict the displacements and in-plane

stresses at strategic points. Most of the models based on the higher-order theories do not provide enough information on inter-laminar stresses, as the continuity of the transverse shear stresses at the interfaces is not fulﬁlled. In the studies mentioned above, the torsional stiffness of stiffeners was neglected. Guo et al. [18] proposed a layerwise ﬁnite element for buckling analysis of stiffened laminated plates. Although the layerwise ﬁnite element model can accurately predict the buckling behavior of the stiffened laminates, it requires huge computing effort for multilayer structures as the number of unknown functions depends on the number of the layers of the laminates. Most of the previous studies were limited to the prediction of global response of the stiffened laminated plates. Very little effort has been spent on the analysis of local response of the stiffened laminated plates. Although the use of the stiffeners in the plates can improve the strength-to-weight ratio, it also results in complex stress distributions in the structure. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a model capable of accurately predicting the local response as high local stresses may cause delamination and cracks which will decrease the strength and stiffness of the plates, as well as their lifespan. In this paper, a ﬁnite element model based on the higher-order global–local theories is proposed to study the local response of thick stiffened laminated plates. In the proposed method, the stiffeners are also considered as multilayered plates, so that the stiffened plates can be treated as the laminated plates with thickness discontinuity. The same technique was used in article [19]. The compatibility of the displacements and stresses at the interface between the plate and stiffeners can be satisﬁed by joining the equations of plate and stiffeners. The proposed model is able to accurately predict transverse shear stresses without any postprocessing. 2.

The convergence rate of central deﬂection for laminated plate with a stiffener is shown in Table 1. The number in bracket of all tables denotes the number of ﬁnite element meshes used. It can be found that the convergence of the present results with mesh reﬁnement is very good. The center deﬂections for laminated plate with and without stiffeners are presented in Table 2. Numerical results show that the present results obtained from the ﬁrst order theory agree well with the ﬁrst-order ﬁnite element results published [2]. In addition, the following examples are considered to further assess the proposed methods. Example 2. It this example, simply-supported square unstiffened and stiffened laminated plates subjected to sinusoidal loads q = q0 sin (px/a) sin (py/b) are analyzed. The material constants [17] are given by

For unstiffened ﬁve-layer plate (0⬚/90⬚/0⬚/90⬚/0⬚) and (6.667/10/ 6.667/10/ 6.667) mm, side length a = 400 mm and thickness

h = 40 mm, the present results are compared with the exact solutions [25] and other results obtained from the higher-order theories [15,17] in Table 3. It is found that the results obtained from present models are in excellent agreement with the exact solutions. Moreover, the transverse shear stresses obtained from the present models are also given in Table 3, which were not published in [15,17]. Subsequently, the case of a square laminated plate stiffened by four equally spaced laminated x-stiffeners (See Fig. 2) is considered. The geometrical properties are, for plate: side length a = 800 mm, thickness h = 23.33 mm, three layers (0⬚/90⬚/0⬚) and (5.833/11.667/ 5.833) mm; and for stiffeners: cx = 30 mm, dx = 111.11 mm, stacking (0⬚)8 and (13.89 mm)8. The maximum displacement and stresses are shown in Table 4. Without any assumption for plate and stiffeners in the present method, the present higher-order models should be more advanced. The distributions of in-plane stresses through the thickness of plate and stiffeners are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. It is clearly seen that maximum in-plane stress rx occurs at point 1 of stiffener (See Fig. 2). Moreover, the ﬁrst order theory clearly underestimates the in-plane stresses in stiffener of stiffened plates. Subsequently, the distributions of transverse shear stresses through the thickness are presented in Figs. 6–8. Numerical results show that the transverse shear stresses in stiffeners are remarkably higher than those in the plate. It can imply that the failure of stiffened

laminated structures may ﬁrstly occur in stiffeners. However, prediction of transverse shear stresses in stiffened laminated plates is lacking in the published literature. Numerical results also show that transverse shear stresses obtained from the ﬁrst order theory are discontinuous through the thickness of laminates. The distribution of in-plane displacement through the thickness of stiffener is given in Fig. 9. A moderately thick ﬁve-layer plate stiffened by four equally spaced laminated x-stiffeners is also analyzed in this example. The geometrical properties are, for plate: side length a = 400 mm, thickness h = 28.33 mm, ﬁve layers (0⬚/90⬚/0⬚/90⬚/0⬚) and (4.722/ 7.083/ 4.722/7.083/4.722) mm; and for stiffeners: cx = 15 mm, dx = 77.78 mm, stacking (0⬚)7 and (11.11 mm)7. Maximum displacements and stresses are given in Table 5. Furthermore, distributions of displacements and stresses through the thickness are shown in Figs. 10–17. The distributions of in-plane stresses through the thickness of laminated plate are plotted in Figs. 10, 12 and 13. It can be observed that the in-plane stresses in the laminated plate obtained from the higher-order theories are close to those computed from the ﬁrst order theory. In Fig. 11, however, it is found that the in-plane stress in the stiffener predicted from the higher-order theories remarkably differ from those obtained

from the ﬁrst order theory. Subsequently, comparison of transverse shear stresses is presented in Figs. 14–16. Numerical results show that the transverse shear stresses obtained from the higher-order global–local theories satisfy the continuity conditions at interfaces whereas the ﬁrst order theory violates the inter-laminar continuity conditions of transverse shear stresses. In addition, this example shows that the maximum in-plane stress rx and transverse shear stress sxz usually occur in the stiffeners. The distributions of inplane displacement through the thickness of stiffener are also plotted in Fig. 17. It should be emphasized that the present results are based on the thick laminated structures. However, for thin stiffened laminated structures usually used in engineering, the beneﬁt of the proposed formulation should be smaller. For example, a thin ﬁve-layer plate stiffened by four equally spaced laminated x-stiffeners is also analyzed. The geometrical properties are the same as those of the moderately thick stiffened plates, and except that a = 800 mm, cx = 25 mm, dx = 93.33 mm, stacking (0⬚)7 and (13.33 mm)7. The corresponding results are shown in Table 6. It can be found that for thin stiffened laminated plates, the results obtained from the higher-order theories are nearly the same as those calculated from the ﬁrst order theory. In addition, a sevenlayer plate stiffened by four equally spaced laminated x-stiffeners

The geometrical properties are for plate: side length a = 400 mm, thickness h = 31 mm, ﬁve layers (0⬚/90⬚/0⬚Á Á Á) and (3.875/5.167/3.875/5.167/3.875/5.167/3.875) mm; and for stiffeners: cx = 15 mm, dx = 60 mm, stacking (0⬚)6 and (10 mm)6. In Table 7, the results obtained from the present model are compared with the published results [15,17]. Numerical results show that the ﬁrst order theory clearly underestimates the in-plane stresses in stiffeners of stiffened plates. 4.2. Effects of arrangement of stiffeners on bending response of stiffened laminated plates

This example used the ﬁfth-order theory to study the effects of the number and the geometry of stiffeners on static response of stiffened laminated plates. The material constants used are the same as those of Example 2. Type 1 [15,17] Problem 1: Square laminated plate without stiffeners, and the geometrical properties are given by Side length a = 400 mm, h = 40 mm and stacking: seven layers (0⬚/90⬚/0⬚Á Á Á) and (5/6.667/5/6.667/5/6.667/5) mm. Problem 2: Square stiffened laminated plate, the geometrical properties are Plate: Side length a = 400 mm and h = 28.33 mm. Stacking sequence: Five layers (0⬚/90⬚/0⬚/90⬚/0⬚) and (4.722/7.083/ 4.722/7.083/4.722/7.083/4.722) mm. Stiffeners: Number of stiffeners N = 4, cx = 15 mm, dx = 77.78 mm. Stacking (0⬚)7 and (11.11)7.

At the current stage, the proposed ﬁnite element model is only suitable for the stiffened laminated plates with stiffener laminations parallel to the lamination of the plate.

ously smaller than those for Problems 2 and 3. Moreover, the maximum in-plane stresses in stiffeners for Problem 1 are almost the same as those in laminated plate, which are desirable results. In addition, it is also seen that the maximum transverse shear stresses at point B of stiffeners for Problem 1 are the smallest among the three problems. Distributions of the maximum in-plane stresses through the thickness of stiffeners for different problems are plotted in Fig. 19. Transverse shear stress distributions through the thickness of plate are shown in Fig. 20. In addition, distributions of transverse shear stresses through the thickness of stiffeners are plotted in Fig. 21. This example is a further indication that the arrangement of the stiffeners may be designed to improve the stiffness and the strength of stiffened laminated plates. 5. Conclusions A ﬁnite element model based on the higher-order global–local theories is proposed for the bending analysis of stiffened laminated plates. In the proposed method, the laminated stiffeners are also considered as multilayer plates, so that the stiffened plates can be treated as laminated plates with thickness discontinuity. The compatibility of the displacements and stresses at the interface between the plate and stiffeners can be satisﬁed by joining the equations of plate and stiffeners. The advantage of the proposed method is that the transverse shear stresses, which are often disregarded by other researchers, can be accurately predicted. The proposed method was used to analyze a number of bending problems of thin and thick stiffened laminated plates with different stacking sequences. Numerical results showed that the maximum in-plane and transverse shear stresses usually occur in stiffeners. Moreover, the maximum transverse shear stresses in stiffeners are signiﬁcantly larger than those in plates. For the thick stiffened laminated plates, the ﬁrst order theory underestimated the in-plane stresses in stiffeners, and violated the continuity conditions of transverse shear stresses at interfaces. Such results showed that the ﬁrst order theory presents difﬁculties to accurately predict the local response of thick stiffened laminated plates. The impact of the stiffeners on bending response of the stiffened laminated plates is also studied. Numerical results showed that by varying the quantity, the location and the geometry of stiffen-
