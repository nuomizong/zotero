1 INTRODUCTION

The major difficulties in the adaptive analysis of stiffened shells are the modelling of stiffened elements and the mesh generation of three-dimensional curved surfaces. The conventional finite element models for the stiffened shells have the shell elements arranged such that the stiffeners are

restricted to shell element nodal lines. This restriction causas difficultyin the automaticmesh generationfor the adaptive analysis which results in either excessivemesh refinementor severe mesh distortionin order to keep the element mesh layoutcoincidentwith the actual pattern of stiffeners.In complicatedstiffened shell geometries,this can also requirereplacementof the quadrilateralelements by triangular elements. To overcome this difficulty, Thompsonand Bettessl-3developedau integrallystiffened Ahrnadshellelementwhichcombinesa shellelementwith the stiffenerbeamelementsdistributedin the shellelement. Because the effects of the stiffener and the associated generalizedstrainsare expressedby usingthe shellelement shapefunctionsand theirderivatives,the stiffnesscontribution of the stiffeneris reflectedat all the nodesof the shell

Therefore, the scheme has been applied to generate quadrilateralshell elements6.The work presentedin this paper is a further extensionof our workon elasticityproblems12-14, plateand shell bendingproblems6,and stiffenedplate problems16”7

to stiffenedshellproblems.Numericalexamplesare shown

to illustrate the principles and procedure of the present adaptiveanalysis. 2 INTEGRALLY STIFFENED SHELL ELEMENT
The integrally stiffened shell element was developed by Thompson and Bettessl-3 for the analysis of reinforced openings in ring stiffened shells. The initial attempt at development of the integrally stiffened shell element was for the creation of an optimal mesh layout for stiffened shells as the stiffeners in the conventional finite element models have to be situated along a nodal line of the shell element. This restricts the element mesh layout to having to be coincident with the actual pattern of stiffeners. The integrally stiffened shell element consists of a host shell element and beam elements defining the stiffeners in the host shell element. As the integrally stiffened shell element allows for the placement of discrete stiffeners anywhere within a host shell element and not necessarily along a nodal line, the element mesh can be carried out arbitrarily without taking into account the position of stiffeners. This allows the possibility of creating an optimal mesh layout. The host shell element is defined by natural, curvilinear coordinates (&,q, ~) with a total of 8 nodes on the mid-

uniquely defined as being perpendicular to the shell normal at each node requires some means of restraining the torsional mode of the shell element, but allows the boundary conditions for rotations to be defined in the global coordinatesystem. This is particularlyconvenient for the autoadaptiveanalysisin which the boundaryconditionsare appliedindependently the localelementcoorof dinate systems.The shell elementstrain fieldis written as /?~h B~h”~ = (3) where 6 is the generalizeddisplacementvector and B~his the strain-displacementrelationmatrix. Theformulationof the stiffenercontributions madein the stiffenedshell elementis based on expressingthe generalizeddeformations the stiffenerbeamtransversesectionin of terms of the host shellelementnodalparameters.Thus the strainfieldof the stiffenercan be writtenas s~~ B~t.8 = (4) whereB,t is the strain-displacementrelationmatrixfor the stiffeners.In the derivationsof the matrix ll~t,coordinate mappingis neededfor transformation the globalcoordiof natesof the stiffenersinto the isoparametriccoordinatesof the hostshellelement.Thisis accomplished numerically by solvingtwocouplednonlinearequations. ecausetheeffects B of the stiffenerand the associatedgeneralizedstrains are expressedby using the shell element shape functionsand theirderivatives,the stiffnesscontribution the stiffeneris of reflectedat all the nodes of the shell element, while the stiffenerpositionsand propertiesremain undisturbed. his T allowsarbitrary orientation ofanynumberof stiffenerswithin a shellelement.The formulations detailedderivationof and the stiffness matrix of integrally stiffened shell element were presented in previous papersl-3 and will not be givenhere.

The dimensionlessthicknesscoordinate~ ranges from –1 at the shell lower surfaceto +1 at the shell top surface.As the thicknessof the shell elementis definedin thedirectionof ~,thenormalto themid-surface, heposition t at any pointin the shellelementcan be uniquelydefinedin terms of nodalcoordinateand thicknessesas

This means that the mesh generatedon the two-dimensionalplane is

exactly the same as that generatedon the curved surface. Consequently,the three-dimensionalmesh generation is simplified to two-dimensionalmesh generation. As the mappingis one-to-onebetween the mesh in the plane and that on the three-dimensionalspace, the resultingsurface discretizationis compatiblewith the localmeshparameters in the two dimensions. To generatea meshrequiresthe initialdatathatdefinethe geometryof the curved surfaceexpandedto the plane and the size of elementsto be created in the initial mesh. For example,the geometryof a conical shell expandedto the two-dimensionalplane will be an annulus.After the geometry of the shell on the plane has been defined, the commonmesh generationschemefor the two-dimensional mesh can be employed.After all nodes and elementsare created on the two-dimensional lane,these are mappedto p the three-dimensional oordinatesystemusingeqn (6). c During the adaptive remeshing process in which the elementsizesare calculatedaccordingto the calculatedelementerrors,thereis potentialfor distortingelementshapes, whichcan decreaseaccuracy.Thus,it is necessaryto apply a smoothingalgorithmto the mesh. The smoothingalgorithm used is a combinationof two types,Laplacesmoothing and isoparametricsmoothing.Both methodsare based on the processof systematically repositioning each internal nodeof a meshto a pointwhichis calculatedas a functionof the neighboring nodes.The smoothingthus is an iterative process of the repositioningof nodes. This procedureis repeated until the mesh convergesto some final state in which the error due to distorted shape is minimized.20 After the smoothingthe mid-side nodes of the elements can be created. Duringthe meshingprocesseach nodeis numberedwhen it is created.The numberingis more or less a randomprocess.This arbitrarynumberingresultsin a lessthan optimal band width configurationof the systemmatrix.To reduce the band width, the nodes need to be renumbered.21 The numbering algorithm we employed is dictated by the

methodused to store the systemmatrix.In our case it is a profilestoragescheme.Correctlyimplemented, his method t requires little computationaleffort, but results in a very significantsaving in computing time when solving the systemmatrixequation. Oncethe surfaceelementshavebeen completedthen the intersections betweenthe stiffenersandthe sidesof the shell elementscan be calculated.It is these interactionsthat are required in the definitionof the integrally stiffened elements. When all nodes and elements have been defined, the constraintsand loadscan be appliedto the nodes.Followingthat a data fileis createdwhichis then inputfor the finiteelementanalysisphase. In the adaptiveanalysis,it is usualfirstto createa coarse meshwhichis thenusedin the finiteelementanalysis.Once the initialmeshhas been analysed,an errorestimatecan be carriedout.If the erroris too large,thenthe meshis refined andthe sizesof elementsforthenewmeshcanbe calculated on the informationprovidedin the error analysis.The mesh requiredto be refinedis calledthe previousmesh,or backgroundmesh. A new mesh, or refinedmesh, is generated accordingto the calculated element sizes defined in the backgroundmesh. The new mesh will also have an error estimatewhichcan furthercreateanothernew mesh and so on. This iterativeprocess is carried out until the error is acceptable.

4 ERROR ESTIMATE Error estimatesplay a crucialrole in the adaptiveanalysis whichnot onlyprovidesthe informationaboutthe accuracy of the finiteelementsolutionbut also givesan indicatorfor meshrefinement.As the exact solutionof the problemanalysed is not known,the errors are usually estimatedby a posteriori methods.There are a numberof methodswhich estimatethe discretizationerror of the finiteelementsolutions (see for exampleRef.g,where referencescan also be found).One of the mostpopularmethodsis calledthe stress 9–1 recoverytechnique. 1 In this methodthe errors are estimated by comparingthe differencebetween an improved stresssolutionandtheoriginalfiniteelementstresssolution. The improvedstresssolutionis computedby recoverytechniques on the original finite element stress solution.For medium-thickshells the errors can be estimatedin terms of all stresscomponentsas follows:

In mathematics,the improved stress solutionhas been proven to have at least one order higherconvergencerate than the finiteelement stress solution.9-’1 Thus, the error convergencerate can be expressedas

Note that the accuracy of the elementerroris higherthanthatof the globalerror,because the elementarea in the discussedproblemsis of the order of h2. f The absoluteerrordefinedby eqn(7)is notconvenient or use in practicalcomputations it has an energydimension. as The dimensionless forms are favouredand are customarily expressedby dividingan energynorm as follows:

Equations (17) and (18) give predictionsof the number and sizes of elements to be generated in the new mesh. In theory, if the errors estimated for the previous mesh were completelyexact, the use of the remesh formulation eqn (18) could lead to an optimal mesh at the desired accuracy.

The meshgeneration,errorestimation,andmeshrefinement strategy shown above are integratedwith a finiteelement analysisprogramto conductan auto-adaptive analysis.The flow chart of the adaptive finite element computationis shown in Fig. 2. The present adaptive analysishas been successfullyapplied to the static analysisof plane stress, plate and shell bending and stiffened plate and shell problems.In the following,two examplesof the stiffened shellsare shownto demonstratethe adaptiveprocedure. The firstexampleconsidersa half-cylindricalshell with soft simple support boundary condition (u= v= w= O, M, =h4n =0) for all four edges, subjected to a uniform pressure. The material propertiesand dimensionsfor the shell analysedare as follows:elastic modulus E = 1.7 X ~osm-z, poisson~satio ~= 0.3, shellthicknessh = O.u m> r radius R = 0.636 m, shelllongitudinalspan L = 2.0 m, and pressureintensity = 1.0N m-’. The cross-sections the of two circumferentialstiffeners are 0.04 X 0.04m2. The stiffeners are symmetricallypositioned (no eccentricity) and are of the same material as the shell. The relative accuracywe wish to achievefor this exampleis 5.0%. Figure 3 shows the sequence of meshes, associated numberof integrallystiffenedshell elementsand value of relativeerror.The sequenceof adaptiveanalysisbeginswith a very coarse mesh of 9 shell elements and results in a INPUT ATA D

solutionin which the relative error is 13.570.This initial mesh is refinedto create a secondmesh.The secondmesh of 65 shellelementsgeneratedaccordingto the errorsestimated in the initialmesh and the accuracyto be achieved has a relativeerrorof 8.01%.The secondmeshis remeshed and a new mesh of 186 elementsis created in which the relativeerror is 5.66%.To achieve5.OYO relativeaccuracy,

with the same geometryand materialpropertiesas in the firstexamplebut witha circularholeof diameterd = 0.5 m in the symmetriccentre.The stiffenersare distributedalong the holeand alongthe two symmetricaxesof the shell.The cross-sectionsof the stiffenersare 0.04 X 0.04 mz. The stiffeners are symmetricallypositioned (no eccentricity) and of the samematerialas the shell.The shellis subjected to a uniformpressureand supportedalong the four edges (u= v= w=O, M, = M. = O) but free at the edge of the hole.The relativeaccuracywe wish to achieveis 5.09’0. Figure4 showsthe progressionof meshesand associated numberof integrallystiffenedshellelementsandthevalueof the relativeerror.The sequenceof adaptiveanalysisbegins with an initial mesh of 34 shell elementsand results in a solutionin which the relativeerror is 11.32%.This initial meshis requiredto be refinedto achievethe 5.090accuracy. Afterthreeremeshingsa finalmeshof 502 shellelementsis generatedin which the relativeerror is 4.99%. As is to be expected, the small size elements in the final mesh are locatedin areascloseto the intersections the longitudinal of symmetricaxis, the curved boundariesand the area along the hole edge, againowingto the boundarylayer effects. It should be mentioned that the discretization error definedin the presentstudiesis only for those due to shell elements.The errors associatedwith the stiffenerelements are not taken into account. If the errors due to stiffener elementsare also accountedfor, a very fine mesh around the stiffener area would be required. Sometimes this wouldcausesevereelementdistortionbecauseof the stress discontinuitiesat the boundary of the two neighbour stiffenerelements. 7 CONCLUSIONS

The simple scheme for the generationof a quadrilateral element mesh for expandableshells has been extendedto stiffenedshellstructures.The schemehasbeenincorporated with a sophisticatederror estimate and an effectivemesh refinementstrategyto completean adaptiveanalysis.As the adaptive analysis employs integrally stiffened shell elements the position of stiffeners does not influence the element mesh layout and allows the possibilityto create an optimalmesh. Numericalexampleshave demonstrated thatthepresentadaptiveanalysisis ableto createan optimal mesh in whichthe smallsize elementsare generatedin the areas where required so as to ensure each element in the
created mesh has an identical strain energy norm error.
