Abstract In spite of the large number of ï¬nite elements developed so far, most of these lack in generality, and are found to be inadequate and inefï¬cient in some way or other, when it comes to analyzing plates of arbitrary geometrical conï¬gurations. So far the isoparametric element has been the most successful among available elements because of its ability to model a curved boundary successfully. However, the shear-locking problem inherent in the isoparametric element makes it unsuitable for analyzing thin plates of arbitrary shapes. Though research has been conducted using reduced integration and stabilization to overcome the problem, the formulations either do not converge to the correct solution in the thin-plate limit or they make the stiffness matrix a singular one. In this paper, a four-noded stiffened plate element is developed. This has the advantages and elegance of an isoparametric element in modelling arbitrary shaped plates, but without the disadvantage of shear-locking phenomena. Though this element is a high-order element, only the usual degrees of freedom have been considered, and performance is superior to that of the low-order ones. The stiffened plate element has the feature of accommodating the arbitrary shape of the plate geometry, and the stiffener modelling has been done in a general manner, with the stiffener lying anywhere with arbitrary orientation, and not necessarily following the nodal lines. The new element has been successfully used for the static, free vibration and stability analyses of arbitrary bare and stiffened plates. The results are found to agree quite satisfactorily with those of previous investigators. ï 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Many engineering structures consist of elements in the form of thin plates having different shapes, which are often stiffened with stiffening ribs for achieving greater strength with relatively less material. This improves the strength/weight ratio, and makes the structure cost-effective. Thus, there is wide applicability of stiffened plates in various areas, such as naval architecture, aerospace engineering, bridge engineering, buildings and many other modern industrial structures. These plates of arbitrary geometrical conï¬gurations are subjected to static lateral loads, dynamic loads and in-plane loads for which static, free vibration and stability analyses are required to be carried out. In such analyses, the geometry of the plate plays a major role in the choice of the approaches and methods of solution of the problems. Attempts to obtain analytical solutions for these arbitrary plates may lead to extremely tedious (though not impossible) tasks because of the complex nature of the problem arising out of a curved boundary. The ï¬nite-element method has been rigorously tested and proven as a powerful tool for the analysis of structures with simple mathematical descriptions as well as to those with complexities. In the ï¬nite-element analysis of plates with arbitrary geometrical conï¬gurations, the main problem arises in choosing a suitable element because of the shortcomings of many of the present available elements in modelling the arbitrary nature of the plate geometry. In the past, many researchers used various elements in trying to accommodate the arbitrary boundary line of the plate. The most common approaches were to approximate the curved boundaries with a large number of straight-edged triangular elements (as done by Anderson et al. [1], and Herrman [2]), or to adopt special-purpose elements permitting the exact representation of curved boundaries (Olson and Lindberg [3]), or to use a triangular element with one of the sides being modiï¬ed to include a curved edge (Chernuka et al. [4]). However, none of these approaches can be generalized to represent an arbitrary edge such as straight, skew or curved. So far, the most successful approach in this pursuit is the application of the isoparametric element, owing to its ability to model a curved boundary successfully. However, in the analysis of very thin plates, the shear-locking problem (arising out of the shear-strain term considered in the Mindlinâs theory) associated with the isoparametric element becomes a major drawback for this otherwise successful element. Though the methods of reduced and selective integration are efï¬cient approaches in preventing the appearance of the shear-locking phenomenon in the Mindlin plate elements, it is found that such elements often exhibit extra zero energy modes, and yield oscillatory results for some problems (Wanji and Cheung [5]). A Mindlin plate element utilizing reduced integration techniques was developed by Hughes et al. [6] This was found to be rank-deï¬cient, resulting in singularity of the stiffness matrix. To overcome these deï¬ciencies MacNeal [7], Hughes and Tezduyar [8], and Belytschko and Tsay [9] developed stabilization techniques, but the formulations are unable to converge to the correct solution within the limitation of the thin-plate

bending problem [5]. Other investigators [10,11] developed some improved quadrilateral Mindlin plate elements by using the natural coordinate interpolation system. Recently, an interesting investigation has been conducted on all these aspects in a survey paper by Yang et al. [12]. In this paper, a new four-noded stiffened-plate bending element is proposed for the analysis of bare as well as stiffened plates. This is derived by combining the four-noded rectangular plane-stress element having 8 degrees of freedom with the simplest rectangular plate-bending element having 12 degrees of freedom (commonly known as the ACM Element, after Adini, Clough and Melosh [13,14]). Details of the ACM element are presented in textbooks [15,16]. It has all the advantages of the isoparametric element in modelling an arbitrary plate shape, but without the disadvantage of the shear-locking problem. Another feature of the element is that the orientation and the position of the stiffeners inside the plate element are without any restriction and hence need not necessarily be positioned between nodes. This is advantageous as the mesh division is independent of the location of the stiffeners. The previous practice of replacing the stiffeners with a plate of orthotropic properties or of shifting the stiffeners to nodal lines has been done away with in this element. This is achieved by using the same interpolation function as for the plate element and expressing the stiffness matrix of the stiffener element in terms of the nodal parameters of the plate element. 2. The problem The equations of equilibrium for an elastic system undergoing small displacements for static, free vibration and stability analyses respectively, are: [K]{d [K]{d {0 [K]{d l[KG]{d {0 (3) where [K], [M] and [KG] are the global elastic-stiffness, consistent-mass and geometric-stiffness matrices respectively, {d} and { ##Unknown accent lookup code : d Â¨ , align : U##} are the displacement and acceleration vectors in the global coordinate system, and {P} is the load vector. 3. Finite element formulation The derivation of the fundamental equations for stiffened plates is based on the following assumptions: 1. The normal to the middle plane of the plate before bending remains straight and normal to the middle plane of the plate after bending. {P [M]{##Unknown accent lookup code : d Â¨ , align : U## (1) (2)

2. The common normal to the plate and the stiffener system before bending remains straight and normal to the deï¬ected middle plane of the plate after bending. 3. The horizontal bending of the stiffener is not taken into account. 4. The stress in the z-direction is small compared with the other stress components and is thus neglected.The material of the plate and the stiffener is the same and obeys Hookeâs law. 5. The lateral deï¬ection of the plate is small compared to the thickness of the plate. In the proposed ï¬nite element formulation, the arbitrary shape of the whole plate (Fig. 1(a)) is mapped into a master plate of square region [â1, +1] in the sât plane as shown in Fig. 1(b) on the basis of the relationship between the twelve peripheral nodes, namely (Zienkiewicz and Taylor [17]):

where (xi, yi) are the coordinates of the i-th node on the boundary of the plate in the xây plane and Ni(s,t) are the corresponding cubic serendipity shape functions. The master plate in the sât plane, which is a square one instead of an arbitrary one, is divided into a number of rectangular elements as shown in Fig. 2(a). For each rectangular element in the sât plane, twelve suitable nodes at the boundary are chosen, and their (x, y) coordinates are determined by using Eq. (4), which is based on the mapping of the whole arbitrary plate to the master plate of Fig. 1(b). With the (x, y) coordinates of the twelve nodes on the boundary of each rectangular element being known, each element is then mapped into a master element of square region [ân1, +1] in the Î¾âÎ· plane, as shown in Fig. 2(b), in the same way that the original plate was mapped into the master plate in the sât plane using the same cubic serendipity shape functions of Eq. (4), but with the variables changed from (s, t) to xâh.

3.1. Displacement function As the element is in the xâh plane, the shape functions and the nodal parameters for the displacements and the slopes are expressed in terms of the coordinates x and h, instead of the x and y coordinates of the parent ACM element.

The shape functions for the displacement ï¬eld corresponding to a particular node for the in-plane and the out-of-plane displacements can be obtained from any standard text book, such as Zienkiewicz and Taylor [17]. 3.2. Elastic stiffness matrix of the plate element The stressâstrain relationships for the plate element can be expressed as {sp} [Fx Fy Fxy Mx My Mxy]T [D]a [D]f {ep} [Dp]{ep} (8)

where {sp} is the stress-resultant vector, Fx, Fy, Fxy are the in-plane forces, Mx, My, Mxy are the moments, and { p} is the strain vector. For an isotropic material,

By using the interpolation functions for u, v and w, and making use of the relationships for the ï¬rst- and second-order derivatives between the (x, y) and xâh coordinates as given in Barik & Mukhopadhyay [18], the strains can be expressed in terms of nodal displacements as {ep} {ep} [Bp]{dp} [Bp]{dp} (11)

The stiffness matrix of the plate element can be expressed as (12)

where |J | is the determinant of the Jacobian. 3.3. Mass matrix of the plate element Considering the in-plane as well as the lateral displacement, and for constant thickness t and mass density r, the consistent mass matrix for the plate element can be expressed as [Mp] rt [N]T[L]T[P][L][N] |J| dx dh (13)

3.4. Geometric stiffness matrix of the plate element The action of the in-plane loads causing bending strains is considered for the analysis of the buckling behaviour. The stiffness matrix is modiï¬ed by another matrix known as the geometric stiffness matrix. As the contribution of the in-plane displacements to the geometric stiffness matrix is insigniï¬cant, the in-plane displacement are ignored while considering the displacement ï¬eld of the plate element. Thus, the geometric stiffness matrix of the plate element is obtained as [KpG]e where

3.5. Elastic stiffness matrix of the stiffener element As a general case, a curved stiffener having eccentricity with respect to the midplane of the plate, and placed anywhere on the plate element, is considered as shown in Fig. 3. Since the stiffener is a curved one, its direction changes from point to point, and hence a local axis (x ) is considered along the tangent to the stiffener at the Gaussian integration point P, making an angle Î± with the global axis (x). The generalized stressâstrain relationship for an eccentric stiffener in the local (x ,y ) system can be expressed as {ss} where [Fs Ms Ts]T [Ds]{es} (22)

As the strain vector is expressed in terms of displacements at the mid-plane of the plate, the displacement shape functions used are the same as that of the plate element, which yields the stiffness matrix of the stiffener in terms of the nodal parameters of the plate element.

The stiffness matrix of the stiffener element can be expressed as [Ks]e [Bs]T[Ds][Bs] dl [Bs]T[Ds][Bs]|Jst| dl (27)

Here, l is taken along the stiffener axis in the xây plane, and is in the direction of the stiffener axis in the xâh plane; the Jacobian |Jst| is the ratio of the actual length to the length on the mapped domain for any segment of the stiffener. 3.6.

Rectangular multi-stiffened plates A rectangular steel plate stiffened with nine equispaced T-stiffeners along the short span, which was investigated by Smith [20], is analysed by the present method with a mesh division of 16 Ã 16 over the whole plate. The plate is subjected to a concen-

The deï¬ections and bending moments along the central line in the longitudinal direction are computed, and the results are compared graphically in Figs. 4 and 5 with those of Smith [20], who solved the problem based on generalized slab-beam analysis. 4.2. Stiffened skew bridge deck A perspex scale model of a 45Â° skew bridge deck (Just [21]), having ï¬ve equispaced longitudinal beams and two transverse edge beams supported at the ends of each of the equally spaced longitudinal beam is analyzed with a mesh of 16 Ã 16 applied over the entire plate. The vertical deï¬ection and movement in the direction of the axes of the transverse beam at the supported points is restrained, and the deck is subjected to a concentrated vertical load of 100 N acting at the midpoint of one of the longitudinal free edges. The transverse and longitudinal beams have depths and widths of 22.0 mm and 6.0 mm respectively. The Youngâs modulus and Poissonâs ratio for the 3 mm-thick slab are 3354.0 N/mm2 and 0.390 respectively, and those for the beams are 3176.0 N/mm2 and 0.335 respectively. The vertical deï¬ections along the loaded free edge and along the centre line in the transverse direction

Free vibration of rectangular multi-stiffened plates Rectangular plates with unidirectional concentric stiffeners for varying number of panels and different aspect ratios (Wah [22]) are analysed by the present method using a mesh division of 16 Ã 16, and the ï¬rst four frequencies are compared in Table 1 with the ï¬nite difference results of Wah [22] and the ï¬nite element results of Mukherjee and Mukhopadhyay [23].The results show good agreement. 4.4. Free vibration of eccentrically stiffened annular sector plate Annular sector plates simply supported on two radial edges having stiffeners along the two circumferential edges, as previously considered by Mukhopadhyay [24], are solved and the ï¬rst six natural frequencies obtained are compared in Table 2. Stiffeners of two sizes denoted as S1 and S2 are considered in the analysis, where S1 is an inverted T-shaped stiffener with a 4.0 Ã 0.5 web and a 4.0 Ã 5.0 ï¬ange, while S2 is another T-shaped stiffener having an 8.0 Ã 0.25 web and a 4.0 Ã 0.5 ï¬ange,

The results agree well for all the frequencies. 4.5. Buckling of skew stiffened plates with different boundary conditions Skew stiffened plates with a concentric central stiffener and having different boundary conditions have been analyzed for different skew angles, and the buckling parameters are presented in Table 3. The present results are compared with the ï¬niteelement results of Mukhopadhyay and Mukherjee [26] and those of Mizusawa et al. [27] who analyzed the problem using B-spline functions. The present results are closer to those of Mizusawa et al. [27] than those of Mukhopadhyay and Mukherjee [26]. The element Mukhopadhyay and Mukherjee used does not give consistent results for the clamped condition unless the rotation along the clamped edge is released [28], which explains why results are much higher.
