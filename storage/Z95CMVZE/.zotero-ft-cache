Abstract The paper presents the development of a new stiffened shell element and subsequent application of this element in determining natural frequencies and mode shapes of the different stiffened structures. In the present method each stiffener is treated as a discrete one. The stiffener is modelled in such a way that it can be placed anywhere within the shell element. The method has the advantage over most approximate analyses of being applicable to any shell and stiffener conﬁguration. The analysis becomes considerably more ﬂexible due to this idealisation. Various types of shallow and deep stiffened shell structures have been analysed and the results have been compared with the previously published results.  2003 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction In engineering construction the rib stiffened plates/shells structures are no doubt widely used. The dynamic characteristics of these structures are of much interest for the design purpose. Broadly speaking there are two categories of analysis of rib stiffened shells.

First, the stiffened structures are generally modelled into a simpler structural form, such as orthotropic plate/shell. This is done by smearing the properties and effects of the stiffeners or the corrugations over the surface of the plate/shell. However, there is a severe restriction in the applicability of the model to a generalised problem which is due to the simplicity inherent in the approximation. The orthotropic model can be applied when the stiffeners are identical, light, closely spaced and having equal spacing and the orientation of stiffeners is orthogonal. When, however, the spacing of stiffeners is too large or when the wavelength of vibration is smaller than the spacing of stiffeners, this orthotropic model cannot represent the plate accurately. Secondly, the rib stiffened plate/shell structures are replaceable by the plate/shell beam idealisation where the plate/shell and the stiffeners are separately modelled maintaining the condition of monolithic construction. This is more realistic and accurate. The second type of analysis is of course much more complex but a still better picture of the structural behaviour is obtained from it. It has been adopted for the analysis of rib stiffened and corrugated plate in the present investigation. There is an abundance of literature with description in this ﬁeld. Dynamic behaviour of stiffened shells has been extensively investigated and reviewed by Mukhopadhyay and Sinha (1992) and Sinha and Mukhopadhyay (1995). Among the different methods available for the free vibration solution of stiffened shell the following are the most common: (i) Closed-bound solution; (ii) Energy method; (iii) Other numerical methods. Of the various numerical techniques available at present the ﬁnite element method is certainly the most versatile and accurate, on account of its ability to cater any arbitrary geometry, material anisotropy, nonhomogenity. In this paper a stiffened shell element has been developed with which shallow and deep shells of any geometry can be analysed conveniently. This paper presents the development of a general three noded triangular shell element. The basic shell element employed here is a combination of DKT (Discrete Kirchhoff’s Triangle) plate bending element (Stricklin et al., 1969) and Allman’s plane stress triangle (Allman, 1984). Though the basic shell element has already been used by Samanta and Mukhopadhyay (1998a, 1999a), to derive the frequencies of unstiffened structures (like folded plate, conveyor belts), but for the ﬁrst time the element has been used as a stiffened form for the dynamic analysis of stiffened structures.

2. Mathematical formulation The equation of free vibration for a discretised elastic structural system undergoing small displacements can be expressed in the following matrix form as: ¨ [K]{δ} + [M]{δ} = {0}, (1)

¨ where [K] and [M] are overall elastic stiffness and mass matrices respectively, {δ} and {δ} are the global displacement and acceleration vectors respectively with respect to the reference axis system. 2.1. Shell element formulation 2.1.1. Stiffness matrix of the basic shell element The basic ﬂat shell element employed here is a combination of DKT (Discrete Kirchhoff’s Triangle) plate bending element (Stricklin et al., 1969) and Allman’s plane stress triangle (Allman, 1984). Fig. 1(a) shows the element for discrete Kirchhoff’s triangle (DKT). Starting point in the bending element is a 6-noded triangle (Fig. 2(a)) having 12 degrees of freedom which are reduced to 9 degrees of freedom by using constraint conditions. Fig. 1(b) shows the element for Allman’s plane stress triangular element. Starting point in the formulation of the membrane element is also a 6-noded triangle (Fig. 2(b)) having 12 degrees of freedom which are reduced to 9 degrees of freedom by using constraint conditions. The degrees of freedom ﬁnally are u, v, w, θx , θy and θz at three corner points of the element. The derivation of shell stiffness matrix is given here brieﬂy as it was given in details elsewhere (Samanta and Mukhopadhyay, 1998a, 1998b, 1999a, 1999b). The lateral deﬂection w is assumed to vary cubically in an edge-tangent coordinate s. The value of s is equal to zero at one node and equal to the length of the side at the other node. Lateral deﬂection w can be expressed as w = a0 + a1 s + a2 s 2 + a3 s 3 , where a0 , a1 , a2 and a3 are constants to be evaluated. (2)

The quadratic variation of displacements for bending can be written as

(3)

where, Ni ’s are the quadratic shape functions in area co-ordinates. Applying certain constraints, the twelve nodal degrees of freedom are expressed in terms of nine nodal degrees of freedom w, w,x and w,y at the corner nodes. In matrix form the relation can be expressed as [ θx1 θy1 θx2 . . . θy6 ]T = [Tb ][ w1 w,x1 w,y1 . . . w,y3 ]T , (4)

where [Tb ] is the transformation matrix of size 12 by 9. The derivation of transformation matrix [Tb ] is discussed in details by Samanta and Mukhopadhyay (1998b). The displacement function for the membrane element can be written as

where Ni ’s are the quadratic shape functions. These twelve translational degrees of freedom have been converted into nine nodal degrees of freedom at corner nodes only by the following transformation matrix. [ u1 v1 u2 . . . v6 ]T = [Tm ][ u1 v1 θz1 . . . θz3 ]T , (6)

where [Tm ] is the transformation matrix used to correlate the midside nodal degrees of freedom to the corner nodal degrees of freedom (detailed formulation of this matrix has been given by Samanta and Mukhopadhyay (1998b)). Using the principle of virtual work, the element stiffness matrix of the shell can be written as x (7) [k]p = [T ]T [B]T [D][B][T ] dx dy,
A

where A is the area of the element, [T ] is the transformation matrix used to correlate the midside nodal degrees of freedom to the corner nodal degrees of freedom: [T ] = [Tm ] [0] [0] , [Tb ] (8)

[B] relates the strains to the nodal displacements and [D] is the rigidity matrix of a plate element. Integration is performed by using three point Gauss quadrature rule in area coordinates. To determine the element stiffness matrix in local coordinate system of a particular element, the global coordinate of each node of that element is transformed into local coordinates. The stiffness matrix has to be transformed into global coordinates from the local coordinate system. A transformation is required for this purpose which is discussed in details by Zienkiewicz and Taylor (1991). A general shell surface is generated by this faceted element. The mass matrix of the shell element is generated by lumped model. As the rotary inertia is neglected so the mass contributes only in u, v and w direction. Frequencies and mode shapes can be determined by solving the equilibrium equations. 2.2. Stiffener element formulation 2.2.1. Stiffness matrix of the stiffener element The formulation of the stiffener has been made in such a way that the stiffener can be placed anywhere within the shell element (Fig. 3). The following assumptions have been made for the formulation of the stiffener. (i) The stiffeners are considered as straight axis ribs in a 3-D space. (ii) The stiffeners will have the same displacements as that of the plating. (iii) The common normal to the plate and stiffener system before bending remains straight and normal to the deﬂected shape after bending. (iv) The middle plane of the shell is taken as reference plane in the analysis of the stiffener, as shown in Fig. 4. The common shape function is used for both the stiffener and the shell element. It not only facilitates expressing the stiffness matrix of the stiffener in terms of the parameters of the shell element, but also maintains the compatibility of the stiffener with the shell.

Fig. 4. A stiffened plate showing the reference axis of the stiffener.

If the arbitrarily oriented stiffener makes an angle φ with the shell elemental local coordinate x (Fig. 3), then the relationship between ξ , η coordinate (stiffener local coordinate) and x, y coordinate can be expressed as ξ = (x − x0 ) cos φ + (y − y0 ) sin φ, η = −(x − x0 ) sin φ + (y − y0 ) cos φ. (9)

The relationship between the stiffener local displacement and shell elemental local displacement can also be expressed in a similar manner as  u = u cos φ + v sin φ,   θξ = θx cos φ + θy sin φ, (10)   θη = −θx sin φ + θy cos φ, where u , θξ and θη are the deﬂection and rotations in the stiffener local coordinate system as shown in Fig. 3. The generalized strain vector {εs } in the stiffener local coordinate (ξ, η) is given by {εs }T = ∂u ∂ξ − ∂θξ ∂ξ − ∂θη . ∂ξ (11)

As the strain vector is expressed in terms of displacements in the shell middle plane, the shape function used is the same as that of the shell element which yields the stiffness matrix of the stiffener in terms of the nodal parameters of the shell element. Thus the compatibility of the shell and the stiffener is ensured and also it avoids the incorporation of additional degrees of freedom for the stiffener element which is the most elegant feature of this modelling. The generalized strain in the stiffener local coordinate (ξ, η) has been transformed into the shell elemental local coordinate (x, y) by using the following transformation {εs } = [Ts ]{εs } (12)

where [Ts ] is the transformation matrix for the stiffener to correlate the strain in the stiffener local coordinate to the shell elemental local coordinate. {εs } can be deﬁned as {εs }T = ∂u ∂x ∂v ∂y ∂u ∂v + ∂y ∂x − ∂θx ∂x − ∂θy ∂y − ∂θx ∂y − ∂θy . ∂x (13)

Eq. (9) can be rewritten as x = x0 + ξ cos φ − η sin φ, y = y0 + ξ sin φ − η cos φ (14)

A. Samanta, M. Mukhopadhyay / European Journal of Mechanics A/Solids 23 (2004) 159–179

165

partial derivation of x and y with respect to ξ are ∂x = cos φ ∂ξ and ∂y = sin φ. ∂ξ (15)

Now applying chain rule, strain matrix in the stiffener co-ordinate can be written as ∂u ∂x ∂u ∂y ∂u = + . ∂ξ ∂x ∂ξ ∂y ∂ξ With the help of Eqs. (10) and (15), Eq. (16) can be expressed as ∂ ∂ ∂u = (u cos φ + v sin φ) cos φ + (u cos φ + v sin φ) sin φ ∂ξ ∂x ∂y or, ∂u ∂v 2 ∂u = cos2 φ + sin φ + ∂ξ ∂x ∂y ∂u ∂v + ∂y ∂x 1 sin 2φ 2 (18) (17) (16)

similarly other strain terms in the stiffener local co-ordinate systems can be written as ∂θξ ∂θy ∂θy 1 ∂θx 1 ∂θx =− cos2 φ + sin2 φ + sin 2φ + sin 2φ , ∂ξ ∂x ∂y ∂y 2 ∂x 2 ∂θy ∂θy 1 ∂θη ∂θx 1 ∂θx =− − sin 2φ + sin 2φ + − sin2 φ + cos2 φ − ∂ξ ∂x 2 ∂y 2 ∂y ∂x − So, [Ts ] matrix can be written as  2 cos φ sin2 φ 1 sin 2φ 2  0 0 [Ts ] =  0 0 0 0  (21) (19) .

The strain {εs } in the elemental local coordinate system can be expressed from strain displacement relationship as {εs } = [Bs ][T ]{δ}, (22)

where [Bs ] is nothing but the matrix [B] of Eq. (7), only the last row has been splitted into two parts due to the explicit expression of {εs }. So the order of [Bs ] matrix is 7 by 24 whereas, the order of [B] matrix is 6 by 24. The matrix [T ] has been deﬁned previously and {δ} is the global displacement vector.

The stress strain relationship of the stiffener in the local axis system can be expressed as {σs } = [Ds ]{εs }, ¯ where {σs } = { Nss ¯ and [Ds ] = Es A s Es Ss 0 Es Ss Es Is 0 0 , 0 Gs Js (28) Mss Tss }T (27) (26)

where Nss , Mss , Tss are the axial force, bending moment and torsion in the stiffener. Es is the modulus of elasticity of the stiffener material, As is the cross-sectional area of the stiffener. Ss is the ﬁrst moment of the stiffener cross-sectional area about the reference axis (i.e. the plate middle surface) as shown in Fig. 4. Is is the second moment of the stiffener cross-sectional area about reference axis, Gs is the modulus of rigidity and Js is the polar moment of inertia of the stiffener cross-sectional area. The details of Js is given by Mukhopadhyay and Satsangi (1984). Eccentricity of the eccentric stiffener has been taken care of by the rigidity matrix, where Is and Ss have been calculated with reference to the plate middle surface. For concentric stiffener this eccentricity is zero and Is and Ss have been calculated with reference to the stiffener middle surface, as in this case plate middle surface and stiffener middle surface are same. Using the principle of virtual work, the element stiffness matrix of the stiffener is given by [k]s =
Ls

[T ]T [Bs ]T [Ts ]T [Ds ][Ts ][Bs ][T ] dξ,

(29)

where all the matrices are deﬁned previously. Eq. (29) has been integrated by two point Gaussian quadrature rule along the length of the stiffener Ls , where Ls is shown in Fig. 3. After the element stiffness matrix of the stiffener has been formulated, it has been added with the element stiffness of the shell with which it is attached to get the total stiffness matrix [K] in global form. In the above formulation of the stiffener, as the same displacement function is used for both the shell and the stiffener element, the compatibility condition at the shell beam junction is ensured. The formulation of the stiffener is done in such a manner that it can be placed anywhere within the shell element. Due to this the restriction of mesh grading is obviated and thus the treatment of stiffened shell problems can be carried out in a more elegant manner. 2.2.2. Mass matrix of the stiffener element The mass of the stiffener is distributed along u and w direction only. The mass along θξ and θη directions is neglected. The mass matrix of the stiffener in its local coordinates (ξ, η) is given as 1     ρs A s L s   [Mst ] =   2    1 0 0 1 1 0 0 This mass matrix has been transformed along the shell elemental degrees of freedom (u, v, w, θx , θy and θz ) at the two nodes of the stiffener.

Fig. 6. A diagonally square stiffened plate.

[Mst ] is a 12 × 12 matrix and can also be expressed as Mst = [Mst ]1 [0] [0] [Mst ]2 , (33)

where [Mst ]1 is the mass matrix of size 6 × 6 of the the stiffener at the ﬁrst node of the stiffener element and [Mst ]2 is the mass matrix of size 6 × 6 at the second node of the stiffener element. Based on the position of the stiffener in the shell element, the corresponding area co-ordinates at each node of the stiffener (L1 , L2 and L3 at node 1 of the stiffener element and L1 , L2 and L3 at node 2 of the stiffener element) are evaluated and the stiffener mass matrix is distributed to the shell element nodes using the linear shape functions of the element (Fig. 5). Equivalent mass [Ms ] of the stiffener distributed at the shell elemental nodes can be expressed as   [Mst ]1 , (34) [Ms ] =  [Mst ]2 [Mst ]3 where, [Mst ]i is the contribution of the stiffener mass at the i-th node of the shell element. The expression of [Mst ] is given as [Mst ]i=1,2,3 = L2 Li 2 i Mst 1 + 2 Mst 2 , 2 + L2 + L2 L1 L1 + L22 + L32 2 3 (35)

where L1 , L2 and L3 are the area co-ordinates of the shell element at node 1 of the stiffener element and L1 , L2 and L3 are the area co-ordinates of the shell element at node 2 of the stiffener element (Fig. 5). Eq. (1) has been solved for eigenvalues and eigenvectors by using the simultaneous iteration technique due to Corr and Jennings (1976).

3. Numerical examples and discussions 3.1. Square plate with diagonal stiffeners A square plate stiffened by two concentric stiffeners along the diagonals (Fig. 6) has been analysed for both simply supported and clamped boundary conditions. This problem was originally investigated by Shastry and Rao (1977) by using a high precision √ triangular element. The natural frequencies in terms of nondimensional frequency parameter λ have been presented in Tables 1 and 2 both for unstiffened and stiffened plate. The comparison of frequencies for unstiffened plate has been done by Leissa (1973) and that of stiffened plate by Shastry and Rao (1977).

The stiffness characteristics of the stiffener, namely the stiffness parameter γ is taken as 10. γ can be deﬁned as Es Is /LD, where Es is the Young’s modulus of the stiffener material, Is is the moment of inertia of the stiffener, L is the characteristic length of the plate and D is the plate ﬂexural rigidity. The nondimensional frequency parameter λ is deﬁned as λ = ρhω2 L4 /D where, ρ is the mass density, h is the plate thickness and ω is the circular frequency. The mass parameter for the stiffener δ is taken as 0.1. δ is given by δ = As /Lh, where As is the cross-sectional area of the stiffener, L and h are deﬁned earlier. Taking advantage of the double symmetry only one quarter plate has been analysed by using different mesh gradings. The same problem has also been analysed by 8 × 8 irregular mesh division (shown in Fig. 7(b)) in a quarter plate to show the effectiveness of the stiffener formulation when the stiffeners are passing through the element. From Tables 1 and 2, it can be seen that the maximum percentage of error for unstiffened plate is 0.17% and 0.33% with Leissa (1973) for simply supported and clamped plate respectively, whereas it is 4.21% and 7.48% with Shastry and Rao (1977) for stiffened plate. The maximum deviation occurs in the case of symmetric–symmetric mode of clamped plate. Though Shastry and Rao (1977) have used high precision element for both plate and beam, but they have taken two different elements for the plate and the beam separately, which violates the compatibility between the plate and the stiffener. Moreover, for clamped plate with symmetric–symmetric √ √ mode, the values of λ presented by them have not converged. The values of λ for three different mesh sizes (1 × 1, 2 × 2 and 3 × 3 in quarter plate) are 86.60, 82.20 and 81.07 respectively. From the nature of the convergence it can be seen that the converged value will be lower than that obtained on the basis of 3 × 3 mesh size as the values are monotonically decreasing with the increase of mesh size.

The frequency values given by irregular mesh division (8 × 8) (Fig. 7(b)) are well matched with the corresponding values obtained by regular mesh division (8 × 8) (Fig. 7(a)) for unstiffened plate. For stiffened plate these values, in most cases are slightly less than the corresponding regular (8 × 8) mesh division. This shows that this particular irregular mesh division is slightly less stiff compared to regular mesh division. In addition to the symmetric–symmetric and antisymmetric-antisymmetric mode, an additional antisymmetric–symmetric mode has been presented for stiffened plate in Table 3, which can be useful for future investigators. 3.2. Orthogonally stiffened free-free curved panel A free-free orthogonally stiffened cylindrical shell panel has been analysed with 12 × 12 mesh division for the full shell. Stiffeners are placed in both the circumferential and longitudinal directions and the conﬁguration of the panel is shown in Fig. 8. The material properties are: E = 2.09 × 1011 N/m2 ; ν = 0.3; and ρ = 7800 Kg/m3 . As there is no constraint in the boundary conditions, a shift in the stiffness matrix has been used to avoid the singularity which occurs due to the rigid body displacements. This problem has been solved previously by many authors. Mustafa and Ali (1987) have done experiment for this model. They have also studied the same problem analytically employing different elements. A nine-noded stiffened shell element before reduction and an eight-noded element after reduction (using dynamic condensation procedure of Guyan (1965)) have been used for this purpose. They have also analysed the same problem using the non-conforming FACET element of the PAFEC package. This problem has also been investigated by Jiang and Olson (1994) using super ﬁnite element approach. They have used C 1 cylindrical shell and curved beam elements to model the orthogonally stiffened cylindrical shell.

The same problem was also investigated by Sinha and Mukhopadhyay (1994) by a coarse 4 × 4 mesh division. The basic shell element used for this purpose was a 36 d.o.f three-noded conforming, higher order, triangular shallow shell element. The natural frequencies for the ﬁrst eight modes obtained by the present method along with those of other investigators are tabulated in Table 4. Except for the ﬁrst frequency, the percentage errors between the experimental and the present frequencies for all are within 2%. Table 4 shows that the values predicted by the present method are closer to the experimental measurements than any other investigator. Some of the predictions are lower than the experimental values because of the increased stiffness caused by the presence of ﬁllets at the intersection of the ring and the panel as explained by Mustafa and Ali (1987). The mode shapes of the stiffened panel for the ﬁrst three modes are shown in Fig. 9 along with the experimental and analytical plots presented by Mustafa and Ali (1987). An excellent agreement has been found for the mode shapes with the previous results. 3.3. Simply supported doubly curved stiffened shell A simply supported concentrically stiffened spherical shell has been considered to present the effect of double curvature on the natural frequencies. The geometry and boundary conditions and the material properties of the stiffened shell has been shown in Fig. 10. The same stiffened shell has been investigated by Rao et al. (1993). The ﬁrst ten natural frequencies by present method with different mesh gradings in full shell have been presented in Table 5 along with the frequencies of Rao et al. (1993) for comparison purpose. A good agreement has been found with the results of Rao et al. (1993). For the case of mode number ﬁfth and sixth, the frequencies are missing in the analysis of Rao et al. (1993).

It has been found that these two frequencies are corresponding to inplane mode shape, whereas the other frequencies in Table 5 are corresponding to ﬂexural mode shape. The ﬁfth and sixth frequencies are missing in Rao et al.’s (1993) investigation, may be due to the fact that, they have only taken the ﬂexural vibration of that particular shell. 3.4. Closed cylinder with equally spaced stringers So far the investigations on vibration carried out are on shallow shells. The present example deals with deep shell in the form of full cylinder which is being considered here to check the efﬁciency of the present element formulation. The closed cylinder is stiffened by equally spaced stringers. Two types of stringer arrangements have been considered, (a) four equally spaced stringers and (b) eight equally spaced stringers. The boundary condition has been taken as simply supported without axial constraint. The properties of the shell and the stringer are given in Tables 6 and 7. These problems were previously solved theoretically by Egle and Sewall (1968) using Rayleigh–Ritz procedure. An experimental investigation has been carried out by Schnell and Heinrichsbauer (1964). Taking advantage of the double symmetry about xy, yz and zx planes, only octant shell is analysed by the present method for this cylinder. Though lower frequencies

can be obtained with reasonable accuracy by coarse mesh, but to get higher frequencies accurately and to draw mode shapes correctly the mesh division is increased. Here the octant shell is analysed by 30 × 20 mesh division. A convergence study of frequency for the fundamental mode has been shown in Fig. 11 with different degrees of freedom. The frequencies of the cylinder with four equally spaced stringers have been presented in Table 8 along with the results of Egle and Sewall (1968) for m = 1 and 2 and n ranging from 3 to 12, where m = axial mode number and n = circumferential mode number. Egle and Sewall (1968) have presented a solution by considering the symmetric and antisymmetric mode separately. The frequency spectrum has been shown in Figs. 12 and 13 for four and eight stringers respectively. From Table 8 it can be seen that in most of the cases (particularly in low axial mode number) the results from the present analysis are somewhat lower than those of Egle and Sewall (1968). This is probably due to the fact that the inplane inertias were neglected in the numerical calculations presented in Egle and Sewall (1968). The normalized circumferential modes have been compared. In Figs. 14 and 15 the mode shapes obtained by Egle and Sewall (1968) have been presented for four and eight equally spaced stringers respectively, whereas the mode shpaces obtained by presented method have been presented in Figs. 16 and 17. An excellent agreement has been found between the present mode shapes and the mode shapes obtained by Egle and Sewall (1968).

In the mode shape, the length along the circumference has been normalized. In addition to these mode shapes, some other mode shapes have been shown in Figs. 18 and. 19 for four and eight equally spaced stringers respectively. These will be helpful for future investigators.

4. Conclusions The efﬁciency of the newly developed element has been tested with different types of problem of shallow and deep stiffened shells. Present results when compared with the existing ones have yielded good correlation. The fact that the stiffener can be placed anywhere within the shell element thus obviating the restriction of mesh grading, has enabled the treatment of stiffened shell problems in a more elegant manner. For each and every ﬁnite element formulation, there are some limitations. Finite element models of curved shells with coarse meshes of the ﬂat faceted elements are generally not accurate, but this is expected. An improved accuracy can be achieved by taking proper account of the curvature of a shell in the ﬁnite element formulation. So this element can be taken as a basic element upon which improvement can be made so that the convergence can be achieved in a faster way for the analysis of a curved shell.
