Introduction

A variety of specializations under the umbrella of the mechanical engineering discipline such as aeronautical, biomechanical, and automotive industries are modelled by differential equations. Usually, the problem addressed is too complicated to be solved by classical analytical methods. The finite element method (FEM) is a numerical approach by which general differential equations can be solved in an approximate manner. In other words, FEM is an approximate numerical procedure for analyzing large structures and continua (Cook et al., 1989). Figure 1.1 illustrates generally how the physical phenomenon encountered in engineering mechanics is modelled.

Figure 1.1 Steps in engineering mechanic analysis

2 As the FEM is a numerical, means of solving general differential equations, it can be applied to various physical phenomena. Furthermore, FEM became popular with the advancements in digital computers since they allow engineers to solve large systems of equations quickly and efficiently. The method becomes a very useful tool for the solution of many types of engineering problems such as the analysis of the plate and beam structures, heat transfer and fluid flow. The method is also widely used in the design of air frames, ships, electric motors, heat engines and spacecraft.

Although the finite element model does not behave exactly like the actual physical structure, to obtain sufficiently accurate results for most practical applications become possible. In FEM, the finite element model is created by dividing the structure into smaller parts, called finite elements. Each element is interconnected by nodes and the selection of elements for modelling the structure depends upon the behavior and geometry of the structure being analyzed. The modelling pattern, which is generally called mesh, is a very important part of the modelling process. This is because; the results obtained depend upon the selection of the finite elements and the mesh size. After having determined the behavior of all elements, these elements are then patched together to form the entire region, which enable to obtain an approximate solution for the behavior of the entire body. The situation discussed is shown in Figure 1.2 while Figure 1.3 shows the finite element mesh of the structural part of a car.

Figure 1.2 Illustration of modelling steps

Figure 1.3 Finite element mesh of the structural part of a car

As mentioned in the second paragraph before, one of the applications of FEM is the formulation of plate elements. Plate elements can be formulated and modelled mathematically based on the Kirchhoff plate theory. The focus of this dissertation is to develop the triangular elements for the finite element analysis of Kirchhoff plate problem. An important aspect of the work is to implement the problem on the computer using Matlab programming language. Figure 1.4 shows a region of thin plate is divided into finite elements.

Figure 1.4 A thin plate subdivided into finite elements

4 1.2 Problem Statement

The subject of plates was one of the first to which the finite element method was applied in the early of 1960’s. At that time the various difficulties that were to be encountered were not fully appreciated and the topic remains one in which research is active to the present day. The first convincing plate theory was established by Kirchhoff which therefore also termed Kirchhoff plate theory as described by Boresi et al. (1978) and Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger (1959). In this study, it will be concentrated in deriving a numerical solution for plate problem (for triangular elements), given their boundary conditions by using finite element method. Great effort also will be concentrated in developing the computational scheme of the problem by using Matlab programming language.

5 1.4 Scope of the Study

The dissertation will be focusing on the formulation by using FEM for 2dimensional problem. The simplest plate element for the analysis of plates of arbitrary shape which is the six nodes triangular element mesh with quadratic interpolation functions is considered in this study.

Effort will be concentrated on developing the computational scheme/simulation of the problem by using Matlab programming language.

Introduction

Since Clough (1960) started the evolution of the term finite element, there has been significant developments in finite element method. A large number of different finite elements have been developed and extensively has been used for solving problems in different fields of engineering. The finite element method became even more popular with the advancement of microcomputers and development of various efficient programming languages.

It would be a formidable task to identify and classify all published documents on the subject that is certainly a few thousands. Nevertheless, the subject remains an active area of research because of the importance of plate structures and the difficulty to develop accurate and robust plate ﬁnite elements. This is because, in real world scenario, we can roughly estimate that around 70 percent of finite element modelling of industrial solid mechanics problems is dealing with plates and shells structures.

9 A very large number of plate elements have been developed and the most commonly used plate theories are Kirchhoff plate theory (Timoshenko and WoinowskyKrieger, 1959) and Mindlin-Reissner plate theory (Hughes, 1987). For the present time, we will limit our discussion to Kirchhoff plate theory. In this chapter, the review of the development of plate theory and the establishment of the differential equations of the problem will be discussed.

2.2

Review on the Development of Plate Theory

Tracing the family tree of plate theory to its roots, one travels back to the year 1776 where the earliest performing free vibration of plate problems was discovered. This first mathematical statement of plate problems was probably done by Euler (Ventsel and Krauthammer, 2001). According to Venstel and Krauthammer (2001), Chladni a German physicist, then performed experiments on horizontal plates to quantify their vibratory modes. In the experiment, he sprinkled sand on the plates, and struck them with a hammer, and noted the regular patterns that formed along the nodal lines where no vertical displacements occurred. Bernoulli then attempted to justify theoretically the experimental results of Chaldni. The solution was based on the previous work developed in the Euler-Bernoulli’s bending beam theory, but his results did not capture the full dynamics.

As written in a book by Venstel and Krauthammer (2001), the French mathematician named Germain, developed a plate differential equation that lacked a warping term. By the way, she was awarded a prize by the Parisian Academy in 1816 for her work. But this result has been corrected by one of the reviewers of the

10 Germain’s work, Lagrange. Thus, Lagrange was the first person to present the general plate equation properly.

Cauchy together with Poisson developed the problem of plate bending using general theory of elasticity. Then, in year 1829, Poisson successfully expanded the Germain-Lagrange plate equation to the solution of a plate under static loading. In this solution however, the plate flexural rigidity D was set equal to a constant term (Ventsel and Krauthammer, 2001).

Some of the greatest contributions toward thin plate theory came from Kirchhoff’s thesis in 1850. This theory which presented by Kirchhoff is considered as the first convincing plate theory. This plate theory is therefore also termed Kirchhoff plate theory as described by Boresi et al. (1978) and Timoshenko and WoinowskyKrieger (1959). In analogy with the Bernoulli beam theory, the Kirchhoff plate theory works well for thin plates where the real shear strains J xz and J yz are small. For thicker plates, the Kirchhoff theory becomes questionable, and more refined plate theories must be invoked which allow for the existence of non-zero shear strains. Among such refined plate theories, the one proposed by Mindlin and Reissner is the most prominent (Ottosen and Petersson, 1992). Of the numerous plate theories that have been developed since the late 1800s, these two plate theories, Kirchhoff plate theory and Mindlin – Reissner plate theory are widely accepted and used in engineering. In this study, we only concentrated on Kirchhoff plate theory.

11 2.3 Plate Theory

Plates are initially flat structural members bounded by two parallel planes, called faces, and a cylindrical surface, called an edge or boundary. The generators of the cylindrical surface are perpendicular to the plane faces. The distance between the plane faces is called the thickness t of the plate. It will be assumed that the plate thickness is small compared with all other dimensions of the plate (faces, length, width, diameter, etc.).

In addition, a plate is loaded by forces normal to the plane of the plate. Specifically, a coordinate system is introduced and we assume the configuration of the plate is symmetric about the xy -plane, as shown in Figure 2.1. This means that the xy plane is located in the mid-plane of the plate. Even though the plate thickness t in the

z -direction may vary; it will vary symmetrically about the xy -plane. The plate is
loaded by a transverse loading q , measured as positive in the z -direction. The deflection w of the plate is also measured as positive in the z -direction.

Figure 2.1 Configuration and loading of plate

12 2.3.1 Equilibrium Conditions

For sections normal to the x and y -axes, the stress components V xx , V xy , V xz and V yx , V yy , V yz exist. These stress components give rise to the following forces and moments:

By referring to Figure 2.2, it shows a plane cut in the plate and normal to the x axis. This illustrates the quantities defined by (2.1) and (2.2). The stress components V xx , V xy , and V xz acting on this plane create the quantities M xx , M xy and
V xz which were defined by (2.1) and (2.2), and shown in Figure 2.2. It appears that M xx is the bending moment per unit length, M xy is the twisting moment per unit length

and V xz is the vertical shear force per unit length.

13

Figure 2.2 Illustration of M xx , M xy and V xz

Next, we consider a plane cut in the plate and normal to the y -axis, the stress components V yx , V yy , and V yz acting on this plane create the twisting moment M yx per unit length, the bending moment M yy per unit length and the vertical shear force V yz per unit length. The quantities described are shown in Figure 2.3.

Figure 2.3 Illustration of M yy , M yx , and V yz

Besides these moments and vertical shear forces, the stress components V xx , V yy , and V xy also result in the following horizontal forces:

14 As shown in Figure 2.4, these forces act in the xy -plane. It appears that N xx is the normal force per unit length in the x -direction, N yy is the normal force per unit length in the y -direction and N xy is the horizontal shear force per unit length.

Figure 2.4 Illustration of horizontal forces N xx , N yy , and N xy

To establish the equilibrium conditions for the plate, plate is assumed to be loaded by transverse forces only. Therefore, as no resulting forces (or restraints) act in the xy -plane, horizontal equilibrium requires

N xx

N yy

N xy

0

(2.4)

Consider an infinitesimally small part of the plate as shown in Figure 2.5. As no resulting forces act in the xy -plane (2.4), all forces and moments acting on this small part of the plate appear from Figure 2.5. Vertical equilibrium requires

2.3.2

Kinematic Relations

The plate is assumed to deform in accordance with Bernoulli’s assumption which explains that plane sections normal to the mid-plane remain plane and normal to the mid-plane during deformation. Hence these reach the following displacement in the x , y , and z -plane directions:

ux
uy

u0
X0

z
z

ww wx
(2.8)

ww wy

where u 0 and X 0 are the displacements of the mid-plane in the x and y -directions respectively. It follows that

17
u0 u 0 x, y ;
X 0 X 0 x, y

and

w

w x, y

(2.9)

where the assumption that the deflection w is independent of z have been introduced by (2.9), that is w

w x, y . Given the normal strains are defined:

and the derivation of shear strains are:

(2.11)

Hence, from (2.8) and (2.9), the strains as given by (2.10) and (2.11) become

(2.13)

Noted that the kinematic assumptions imply that the shear strains J xz and J yz are zero.

2.3.3

Constitutive Relations

Assuming that Hookes’s law is applicable, it is not possible to obtain a correspondence between the non-zero shear stresses V xz and V yz necessary to maintain equilibrium in (2.5) and the zero shear strains J xz and J yz . However, as discussed before, the plate is assumed to be thin, and the largest stresses will be V xx , V yy and V xy that are illustrated in Figure 2.6.

Figure 2.6 Illustration of stresses V xx , V yy and V xy

This observation suggests that the assumption of plane stress is most applicable, that is

For isotropic elasticity, the plane stress constitutive matrix D is given by,

(2.16)

However, the D -matrix may take any form. It is even possible to consider initial strains, H 0 for instance, in terms of thermal strains. Due to this, (2.14) is replaced by

(2.17)

Further Derivations

Previously we have the strains as defined by (2.12). This may be written in the form

and N here is denoted the curvature matrix, while H 0 expresses the straining of the midplane. Using (2.18) and (2.14), we have

The matrix M is defined by

Use of (2.20) yields

(2.26)

As discussed in (2.4) before, in the present case, there is no resulting horizontal forces act in the mid-plane. Hence, it can be concluded that

H0

0

(2.27)

22 In accordance with expectations, this shows that there is no straining of the midplane. But even in the situation where the horizontal forces are different from zero, from (2.25) and (2.26) explain that although the moments M are controlled by the curvature matrix N , the horizontal forces are determined by the in-plane strains H 0 . This implies that the phenomena of bending and straining of the mid-plane are uncoupled phenomena, which can be treated separately if (2.24) holds. Moreover, if the mid-plane is deformed, means H 0 z 0 , the phenomenon is called the membrane-action.

Differential Equations for Plate Theory

Previously, we have discussed there is no resulting horizontal forces act in the mid-plane. In this present situation, (2.27) holds, hence (2.18) and (2.20) reduce to

H

zN

and

V

zDN

(2.28)

Recall that the equilibrium conditions were given by (2.5) - (2.7). Since the moments can only be expressed in terms of kinematic quantities, the shear forces
V xz and V yz are eliminated from (2.5) - (2.7). Differentiate (2.6) with respect to y and

(2.7) with respect to x; adding the results and use (2.5) to obtain

w 2 M xx wx 2

(2.29)

23 This equilibrium condition holds irrespective of the constitutive assumption. Introduce the matrix differential operator  , which is defined by

ª w2 º « » 2 « wx2 » « w »  « 2 » « wy 2 » « w » «2 wxwy » ¬ ¼

(2.30)

It happens that the equilibrium condition (2.29) can be written as

T M

(2.31)

Moreover, rewrite (2.19) as

N

w

(2.32)

Hence (2.25) takes the form

M

~ D w

(2.33)

Inserting this expression into (2.31), yields the following differential equation for plate theory:

~ T D w q

(2.34)

When the deflection w has been determined from this differential equation, all quantities of interest can be derived. Assume that the thickness t is constant and that

24 isotropic elasticity is considered, which D is given by (2.16). If, in addition, D does not depend on x and y , (2.34) takes the follows differential equation which is also known as the biharmonic equation. This fourth- order differential equation was derived in year 1811 by Langrange (Reddy, 2007).

Moments and Shear Forces Acting on an Arbitrary Plane

Consider a section in the plate normal to the mid-plane and defined by the unit normal vector n , which is located in the xy -plane as shown in Figure 2.7. A unit vector

m located in the xy -plane is also defined and taken to be tangential to the section, that
is orthogonal to n. Moreover, the vector m is chosen so that n and m , after a suitable rigid-body rotation, follow the same directions as the x and y -axes, respectively.

(2.39)

In defining stress components, we consider a plane normal to the x -axis, and the stress components V xx , V yx and V xz were defined as the components of the traction vector t in the x , y and z -directions respectively. In an analogy to this, for the plane identified by the unit normal vector n , we define the stress components V nn , V nm , V nz as the components of the traction vector in the n, m , and z -directions respectively. These stress components are illustrated in Figure 2.7, and we obtain

As in the definitions (2.1) and (2.2), the bending moment M nn per unit length, twisting moment M nm per unit length and vertical shear force V nz per unit length acting on the section defined by the unit vector n are defined according to

27 For future purposes, some useful relations will be derived from (2.42). The relations are used for FE formulation which will be discussed in details in the next chapter. Previously we have the three-dimensional vectors n and m defined by (2.36) and (2.37), now we define the two-dimensional orthogonal vectors n and m by

n

ªn x º «n », ¬ y¼

ªm x º m « » ¬m y ¼

where

n

(2.43)

These two vectors are located in the xy plane. By carrying out the matrix multiplications it follows that

As this relation holds for arbitrary vectors r , we conclude that R

(2.50)

The relation derived by (2.50) carries the significant aspect since it will later be used in the weak formulation. The weak formulation is in fact a reformulation of the strong form and it is from the weak form that the FE approach is established.

2.7

Boundary Conditions

The identification of proper boundary conditions had already been established by Kirchhoff himself in 1850 (Vitor, 2001). From previous discussion, we have arrived at a two-dimensional problem, where everything depends on the coordinates x and y in the mid-plane of the plate. By referring Figure 2.8, it illustrates that the region spanned by this mid-plane is denoted by A and its boundary by L.

Figure 2.8 Two-dimensional problem formulation of plate theory

30 The assumption for the kinematics of the plate is such that a straight line normal to the mid-plane remains straight during deformation. Along the boundary L , the movement of such a straight line is given by its slope T n , normal to the boundary and its slope T m tangential to the boundary. The situation is shown in Figure 2.9. Therefore, we can identify three kinematic quantities along the boundary which are; the deflection w and the slopes T n and T m .

Figure 2.9 Kinematics quantities w , T n and T m along the boundary

In Kirchhoff plate theory, it is assumed that a straight line normal to the midplane remains straight, and normal to the mid-plane during deformation; we have
Tn
dw dn

and T m

dw dm . That is, the three kinematic quantities identified

are w, dw dn , and dw dm . Suppose that the deflection w is known along part of the boundary, hence we may have w w(m) . This is shown in Figure 2.8. As w(m) is known along the boundary, then the slope dw dm is also known. This means there are only two independent kinematic quantities namely w and dw dn . These quantities are defined as the independent kinematic boundary conditions;

w

and

dw dn

(2.51)

31 Consider next the boundary conditions given in terms of moments and shear forces, which denoted as the static boundary conditions. Referring to (2.41), along the boundary it is able to prescribe the bending moment M nn , the twisting moment M nm and the shear force vector V nz are the static boundary conditions;

M nn ,

M nm

and

Vnz

(2.52)

Whereas there are two independent kinematic boundary conditions given by (2.51), apparently three independent static boundary conditions are defined (2.52). To investigate this problem, the differential equation in w given by (2.34) is considered. Considering the biharmonic differential equation defined by (2.35), it appears that this differential equation is of fourth order. Assuming that the boundary L consists of two regions, one part where the kinematic boundary conditions are prescribed, and another part where the static boundary conditions are prescribed. This condition led to the conclusion that along each of these parts, the solution of the fourth-order differential equation requires the specification of two independent boundary conditions. This criteria is fulfilled for the kinematic boundary conditions (2.51), and it implies that the three static quantities (2.52) must in such a way that they appear in the form of two independent terms.

Hence, this is the significant of the weak form. The weak form by itself gives the natural boundary conditions. Thus, by deriving the weak form of the plate problem, the proper static boundary conditions will be identified. The derivation of the weak form will be discussed in detail in the next chapter.

CHAPTER III

FINITE ELEMENT FORMULATION OF KIRCHHOFF PLATE

3.1

Introduction

In Chapter 2, an overview of plate theory and the establishment of Kirchhoff plate theory have been discussed in detail. The main purpose of this chapter is to present the derivation of the FE formulation of Kirchhoff plate. In this chapter, we shall therefore discuss the weak formulation, hence to the establishment of the FE formulation of the problem.

3.2

Strong Form and Weak Form

The differential equation developed in Chapter 2, given the equilibrium condition defined by (2.29), is known as strong form for the Kirchhoff plate problem.

33 The strong form, in contrast to a weak form, requires strong continuity on the dependent field variables (in this case we have M xx , M xy , and M yy ). These field variables have to be differentiable up to the order of the differential equation that defined in the strong form. Computing the exact solution for a strong form is usually very difficult for practical engineering problems. The finite difference method can be used to solve the strong form to obtain an approximated solution. However, the method usually works well for problems with simple and regular geometry and boundary conditions.

The weak form is often an integral form and requires a weaker continuity on the field variables. Due to this criterion and with the integral operation, a formulation based on a weak form usually produces a set of discretized system equations that give much more accurate results, especially for problems of complex geometry. Hence the weak form is preferred for obtaining an approximated solution. The FEM is a typical example of successfully using weak form formulation. The weak form usually leads to a set of well-behaved algebraic system equations. As the problem domain can be discretized into different types of elements, FEM can be applied for many practical engineering problems with most kinds of complex geometry and boundary conditions.

3.3

Green-Gauss Theorem

In obtaining the weak form, the integration by parts is necessary. Addition to this, in two or three dimensions, a similar type of integration needs to be performed. Since the problem considered is two dimensional problems, for this purpose we shall make use the Green-Gauss theorem, which is based on Gauss’ divergence theorem. These theorems are of fundamental importance applied for many applications in engineering.

34 Given the functions I I x, y and \ \ x, y , and the region A with boundary
L , the arbitrary vector q is defined by

q

ªq x º «q » ¬ y¼

ªI º «\ » ¬ ¼

where qx and q y are the components in the x and y -directions respectively. Given the Gauss’ divergence theorem is defined as

³ div q dA ³

L

q T n dL

(3.1)

where div q is the divergence of q defined by

wq y wy

(3.2)

Assume now that instead of q , consider the vector Iq where I is a scalar. Using the definition (3.2) we obtain
wq y wy

Introduce the definition of the gradient I given by

The Green-Gauss theorem can be seen as the two dimensional counterpart for integration by parts. Most of the cases, it is important to write the Green-Gauss theorem in a slightly different way. If the arbitrary vector q is chosen so that q x \ and q y equation (3.5) reduces to

(3.7)

In the next section, the weak formulation of the problem will be carried out in detail. The equations defined by (3.6) and (3.7) hold the important aspect which the definitions are repeatedly used in deriving the weak form of the problem.

36 3.4 Weak Formulation – Proper Static Boundary Conditions

As already touched upon, we lost one static boundary condition due to the reformulation of the equilibrium equations. Originally, we had the three first-order differential equations (2.5) – (2.7) corresponding to three static boundary conditions. However, when the shear forces were eliminated we arrived at the second-order differential equation (2.29) considered as the strong form, which only requires two static boundary conditions.

Now we shall establish the weak form of equation (2.29). The equation (2.29) can be written as

dM nm is known the dm

3.5

Advantages of the Weak Form Compared to the Strong Form

Generally, FE method is a numerical method to solve arbitrary differential equations. To achieve this objective, it is a characteristic feature of the FE approach that the differential equations in question are first reformulated into an equivalent form,

40 called weak formulation. This is because; the fundamental for the establishment of the FE method is on the weak form that the FE formulation is based.

In order to understand this point, we consider the differential equation in the strong form defined in (2.29). It appears that the unknown functions M xx , M xy and
M yy are differentiated twice. In other hand, the FE approach is an approximate method,

so in one way or another we have to replace the functions by an approximate one. If this approximation is made directly in (2.29), we need to deal with an approximating function, which is at least twice differentiable. However, in the obtained weak form (3.13), only the first derivative enters. That is, if we choose the weak form as the basis for the approximation, we may deal with approximating functions which only need to be differentiable once.

This aspect clearly favours the weak form compared with the strong form, and it also suggests the terminology of weak and strong form. Another point, closely related to the matter discussed before, is that the weak form provides in fact a more general formulation than the strong form. We have previously seen that before deriving the weak form, we have three independent static boundary conditions (2.52). So it is tempting to obtain the weak form of the plate problem discussed since the equation itself gives the natural boundary conditions. After the weak formulation, from the static boundary conditions defined in (2.52), we able to decide on the proper static boundary conditions defined by (3.14).

41 3.6 FE Formulation

Following this, we have a detailed discussion of various aspects of plate theory. Now, we arrive to the establishment of FE formulation of the problem. Previously, as the deflection w is the unknown function in the plate theory (2.34) and (2.35), at some stage the approximation for w quite generally as

Since X X T , (3.19) is also can be written as

Moreover, it is not always possible to divide the boundary into parts where the kinematic boundary conditions are prescribed and parts where the static boundary conditions are prescribed. Indeed, it is entirely possible to have kinematic and static boundary conditions prescribed along the same part. For instance, along a simply supported we have w 0 and M nm
0 . At this point, introduce the constitutive and

kinematic assumptions adopted. From (2.33) and (3.17) we have

Previously, the strong form and the weak form, hence to the establishment of FE formulation of the Kirchhoff plate problem have been discussed in detail. We have seen that once the FE formulation is comprehended, it is a straightforward task to derive the numerical result of the problem. In the next chapter, we shall discuss some general guidelines for the FEM of the problem. In addition to this, the numerical process will be investigated in detail.

CHAPTER IV

NUMERICAL RESULTS

4.1

Introduction

In the previous chapter, a very detailed of FE formulation of the problem has been dealt. This Chapter 4 presents the numerical solution of the problem discussed. But before we arrive to the numerical result of the problem, there are some procedures of FEM must be adopted in obtaining the results.

4.2

General Procedure of Finite Element Method

In FEM, the actual continuum or body of matter is represented as an assemblage of subdivisions called finite elements. These elements are considered to be interconnected at specified joints which are called nodes or nodal points. The nodes

46 usually lie on the element boundaries where adjacent elements are considered to be connected. Since the actual variation of the field variable (in this study is deflection w ) inside the continuum is not known, we assume that the variation of the field variable inside a finite element can be approximated by a simple function. These approximating functions are defined in terms of the values of the field variables at the nodes.

When the field equations (equilibrium equation defined by (2.29)) for the whole continuum are written, the new unknowns will be the nodal values of the field variable. By solving the field equations, which are generally in the form of matrix equations, the nodal values of the field variable will be known. Once these are known, the approximating functions define the field variable throughout the assemblage of elements. The solution of a general continuum problem by the FEM always follows an orderly step-by-step process. Without exception, the derivation of the numerical result of the Kirchhoff plate problem also follows the same procedures. In this study, steps involved generally can be outlined as discretization of the domain, interpolation polynomials, derivation of element stiffness matrices and vectors, assemblage of element matrices and vectors and derivation of system equations, finally the solution of finite element system equations.

4.2.1

Discretization of the Domain

The discretization of the domain or solution region into subregions (finite elements) is the first step in FEM. This is equivalent to replace the domain having an infinite number of degrees of freedom, by a system having finite number of degrees of freedom. The process of discretization is essentially an exercise of engineering judgment. The shape, size, number and configuration of the element have to be chosen

47 carefully such that the original body or domain is simulated as closely as possible without increasing the computational effort needed for the solution.

In this dissertation, the triangular element for two dimensional problem is considered. The domain of the body is defined by assembling two triangular elements with equal subdivisions. This is shown in Figure 4.1.

4.2.2

Interpolation Polynomials

The basic idea of FEM is piecewise approximation, that is, the solution of a complicated problem is obtained by dividing the region of interest into small regions and approximating the solution over each subregion by a simple function. Thus it is a necessary and important step to choose a simple function for the solution in each element. The function used to represent the behavior of the solution within an element is usually called the interpolation function or interpolation model. The chosen of polynomial type of interpolation function depends on some reasons.

48 Firstly, it is easier to formulate the finite element equations with polynomial type of interpolation functions. Specifically, it is easier to perform differentiation or integration with polynomials. The second reason, it is possible to improve the accuracy of the results by increasing the order of the polynomial. Theoretically a polynomial of infinite order yields to obtain an exact solution. But in practice, we take polynomials of finite order only as an approximation. In this study, the quadratic function is selected as the interpolation function. The domain is idealized to discretize into triangular element with six nodes. This is shown in Figure 4.2.

Figure 4.2 Quadratic triangular element with six nodes wi , at corners i 1,2,3 and midpoints i 4,5,6

As two dimensional problem with quadratic model is chosen, hence the deflection w take the form

w x, y

D1 D 2 x D 3 y D 4 x 2

D 5 xy D 6 y 2

(4.1)

Where D1 , D 2 ,...,D 6 , are parameters. In a moment these parameters are expressed in terms of the deflection at the nodal points of the element. As we have six parameters, each element contains six nodal points.

49 A natural coordinate system for a triangular element is shown in Figure 4.3. The natural coordinates are defined as

L1

A1 , A

L2

A2 , A

and

L3

(4.2)

Where A1 is the area of the triangle formed by the points P, 2 and 3; A2 is the area of the triangle formed by the points P, 1 and 3; A3 is the area of the triangle formed by the points P, 1 and 2; and A is the area of the triangle 1, 2 and 3 . As Li are defined in terms of areas, they are also known as area coordinates.

Derivation of Element Stiffness Matrices and Vectors

In previous subsection, the six element shape functions have been successfully derived. Hence we arrive to the computation of the stiffness matrix K, and the load vector f l defined by (3.27). Previously we have matrix B defined by (3.18), D and D given by (2.16) and (2.25) respectively. With derivation of element shape functions in (4.12), and the stiffness matrix K given by

Assemblage of Element Matrices and Vectors and Derivation of System Equations

Since the structure is composed of several finite elements, the individual element stiffness matrices and load vectors are to be assembled in a suitable manner. Thus, we will have the overall system of equations. The procedure for constructing the system equations from the element characteristics is the same regardless of the type of problem, number, and type of element used. For this dissertation, we concentrate over two neighbouring triangular elements. Hence we have the assembled stiffness matrix

Test Example of the Problem

Previously, we have discussed in general the FEM’s procedures of the problem considered. In followings, the numerical example is provided to investigate the computation of the solution of the problem. Consider a thin simply supported square plate of side a 2 m and thickness t 0.1 m with a uniformly distributed load
q 1 u 10
11

Pa as shown in Figure 4.4. The plate is meshed into two element

discretization of six-nodes triangular elements. The discretization can be referred to Figure 4.5. The element numbers and the global nodal numbers are also indicated on this figure. The material has a Young modulus E 30 u 108 Pa and Poisson ratio v 0.3 . In addition to this, since we have a thin simply supported square plate hence the displacements lie on some global points are known. By referring to Figure 4.4 and Figure 4.5, here we can conclude that the displacements of u1 , u3 , u 4 , u5 , u7 and u8 for global points 1,3,4,5,7, and 8 respectively are zeros.

Generally, we have described several procedures of FEM to be considered for the Kirchhoff plate problem and its numerical result example. The computation illustrated that solution of the entire body is established as a sum of the contributions of all elements. In the next chapter, we will over look the computational solution of the problem. The simulation is developed by using Matlab programming language.

COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS

5.1

Introduction

Nowadays, a usage of computer software is important in order to make the information and results distributed faster and efficiently. In a previous chapter, the numerical scheme developed by using FEM in solving the Kirchhoff plate problem has been discussed in detail. In this chapter, the computational code of the problem developed by using Matlab Programming language will be described.

72 The program starts when a sequence of input data is read. Then the area of triangle and the element shape functions for each nodal point in the particular element mesh is derived. Once the definitions completed, matrix B is computed. For each element, the element stiffness matrix K and the element load vector f l are calculated and added to the proper components K and f l using the topology data. This is also known as the assembling process. Then the boundary conditions are read and the boundary vector f b is calculated. Hence, the entire system of equations is established, and after the introduction of the boundary conditions, the modified system of equations is solved. Finally, the results in terms of the displacement are calculated and written out. In the next subsections, the flow of the program code is described.

5.3

The Program Code

In this very first phase, the user will initialize all the data or variables needed in the computation of the problem. For each element, the nodal point of each corner sides will be generated automatically. Table 5.1 shows the declaration of the variables of the problem discussed.

Table 5.1 The declaration of the variables

73 Once the data and variables are initialized, the element shape functions is about to be computed. But the process must be followed with the derivation of the area of the triangle, and the triangular coordinates L1 , L2 , and L3 defined for each element. The computation of element 1 is shown in Table 5.2 below.

Both element meshes considered in the problem will follows the same derivation. Then the expanded matrix for both stiffness matrix and load vector of element 1 and 2 will be computed. This is due as the local nodal points lie in each element corresponds to the global nodal points. In follows, Table 5.3 shows the computation code of the expanded matrix of stiffness matrix and load vector for element 1.

CHAPTER VI

CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTIONS

6.1

Introduction

In this chapter, some conclusions according to Kirchhoff plate modelling by using FEM are discussed. Since this study quite generally discussed the problem, therefore, in this chapter, we conclude some suggestions for further research in the future.

6.2

Summary of the Work

The basic idea in FEM is to find the solution of a complicated problem by replacing it by a simpler one. In FEM, the solution region is considered as built up of

76 many small, interconnected subregions called finite elements. A large number of different finite elements have been developed and extensively used in the field of structural mechanics and other types of engineering problems. The widely discussed of the finite elements developed is plate elements. The plate element is one of the more structural elements and is used to model and analyze structures like automobile parts.

The purpose of this study was to present the Kirchhoff plate element using FEM. This study discussed in detail the FE formulation of the problem which comprises the plate theory, differential equations of the plate theory, boundary conditions, and weak formulation.

In this study, the problem considered was two dimensional cases, with quadratic interpolation functions. The plate elements developed adopted the basic element or the simplest plate element for the analysis of plates of arbitrary shape which was the triangular element.

An example of numerical result was also presented to review the derivation of stiffness matrix K , the load vector f l , and the boundary vector f b , which yielded to the approximate solution for the displacements of the problem. Previously touched upon, the finite element model was two dimensional with quadratic functions; hence it produced six nodes triangular elements.

The major contribution comes from the computational scheme of the problem developed by using Matlab programming language. The program computes the displacements at each node of the finite element model studied. Several test examples were analyzed using the program and the results obtained were studied.

77 6.3 Suggestions for Future Study

This study illustrates the use of Matlab programming language to compute the two dimensional problem of six nodes triangular plate elements. There are some suggestions for future work which include:

1. Discretizating the domain with a small size of finite elements. The size of elements influences the convergence of the solution directly. If the size of the elements is small, more number of elements is derived; the final solution is expected to be more accurate.

2. Improvising the element shapes such as the quadrilateral element. Although a quadrilateral or its special forms, rectangle and parallelogram element can be obtained by assembling two or four triangular elements, in some cases the use of quadrilateral elements proves to be advantageous.

3. Increasing the order of polynomial type of interpolation function. Theoretically, a polynomial of infinite order corresponds to the exact solution. A cubic model for an example produces the ten nodes triangular element for two dimensional cases.

4. Modifying the computational program to include a graphical user interface. The program can be developed using Visual C++ programming language which supports parser feature.
