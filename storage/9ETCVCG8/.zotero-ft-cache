The Appearance Of Objects

Aspects of Appearance
â¢ Shape (geometry) â¢ Surface structure (meso-geometry) â¢ Material (reflectance)
â color, gloss, anisotropy, scattering properties, translucency,â¦

A Combinatorial Search Problem
â¢ Node: A stacking of blocks â¢ Edge: Addition of a block to the bottom of a stacking

Node

Edge

Need efficient pruning strategies!
Root node: empty stacking
[Hasan et al. 2010]

Pruning Strategy 1: âToo Brightâ

any material

If reflection is too high, no added material at the bottom will decrease it. We can prune the node.

[Hasan et al. 2010]

Pruning Strategy 2: âToo Darkâ

100% white

If even 100% white does not increase reflection enough, we deem the search node too dark and prune it.
