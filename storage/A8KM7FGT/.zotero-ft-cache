Figure 1: A model of a dragon was ﬁrst hollowed to reduce stress caused by its weight if held by the head (a). The stress decreased, but the neck had to be still thickened (b,c). The object was still too front heavy causing a twist deformation on the legs (c), that was eliminated by ﬁxing the model to the pedestal by a strut (red) (d). These steps were done automatically by our system.

Abstract
The use of 3D printing has rapidly expanded in the past couple of years. It is now possible to produce 3D-printed objects with exceptionally high ﬁdelity and precision. However, although the quality of 3D printing has improved, both the time to print and the material costs have remained high. Moreover, there is no guarantee that a printed model is structurally sound. The printed product often does not survive cleaning, transportation, or handling, or it may even collapse under its own weight. We present a system that addresses this issue by providing automatic detection and correction of the problematic cases. The structural problems are detected by combining a lightweight structural analysis solver with 3D medial axis approximations. After areas with high structural stress are found, the model is corrected by combining three approaches: hollowing, thickening, and strut insertion. Both detection and correction steps are repeated until the problems have been eliminated. Our process is designed to create a model that is visually similar to the original model but possessing greater structural integrity.

Introduction and Related Work

3D printing enables the physical realization of 3D shapes designed using a computer. Originally, 3D printing referred to powder deposition printing by Z Corporation, but since then it has been used in connection with any additive manufacturing process [Shapeways 2011a], and the various techniques have become an important part of rapid prototyping processes (see the list at [Engineering Handbook 2011]). A 3D printed object is created layer by layer, similar to how a 2D image may be printed line by line. Fused deposition modeling and jetting liquid polymer methods deposit or jet new material for each layer of the printed object. Selective laser sintering, electron beam melting, and powder deposition printing melt or bind powdered material to produce the layers. Many manufacturers produce 3D printers, and their prices are rapidly dropping, though the precision, printable color selections, and material types are increasing, making them more accessible to the general public. The promise of seamlessly moving creations from a virtual space into reality is truly tantalizing, and its applications go far beyond basic manufacturing and rapid prototyping. Unfortunately, many obstacles remain for 3D printing to be practical and commonplace. Although the quality of 3D printing has increased, both the time to print and the material costs have remained high. For a model to be 3D printable, it must meet a set of topological requirements to ensure that its interior and exterior volumes are clearly deﬁned. This is usually achieved by making the input mesh a watertight manifold surface. Producing watertight manifold models from, for example, point clouds or surface representations has been well studied and is available in existing systems [Hornung and Kobbelt 2006; Liu et al. 2007]. Another common requirement is that the input mesh has no parts thinner than the printer can print. However, these requirements do not reﬂect the structural stability of the model. The manufactured objects are commonly so fragile that they do not survive transportation, cannot be handled, and even collapse under their own weight. Whereas the structural properties are a well-studied subject in other disciplines such as mechanical engineering, printability of virtual objects for 3D were addressed only in a limited extent within the context of Computer Graphics. In this context, procedural methods have been coupled with physics-based analysis for masonry buildings [Whiting et al. 2009] and structural analysis has been used for

3D virtual growth of plants and environmental response [Jirasek et al. 2000; Hart et al. 2003]. In general, a structurally stable object can be obtained using methods based on shape optimization [Allaire 2002; Haslinger and M¨ kinen 2003], where the gea ometry of a 3D model is modiﬁed to minimize certain objective function. However, this approach is computationally very expensive for even moderately complex input models (see Section 4.5 for more details). Companies providing 3D printing usually publish a set of constraints that any 3D model should satisfy before it is printed [Shapeways 2011b; Z Corporation 2011] and users are thus responsible to manually check and correct the model before printing. This process can be very cumbersome and time-consuming even for experienced users. Also, these constraints deﬁne only local properties, such as minimal thickness, and they do not capture all possible structural problems. The ﬁrst automatic method devised to detect structural issues of printed objects was proposed by [Telea and Jalba 2011]. The method detects thin and thick parts and then uses a set of basic geometric rules to determine whether a given thin part can support its attached parts. Although the method detects some problematic cases, it lacks the structural analysis component necessary to accurately approximate stress in more complex topological forms. Furthermore, this work does not address the fundamental goal of correcting the detected structural issues. Even in the presence of perfect analysis, it may not be obvious or easy for the user to know where to start making corrections. In our work, we underscore the importance of having both computer-assisted correction and detection combined in a tightly coupled system. We propose a ﬁrst step in the direction of physically based automatic solutions for the detection and correction of major structural problems in 3D models before they are printed, while attempting to minimally alter their appearance as shown in Fig. 1. We ﬁrst detect major printability issues of the input model through printability assessments. In our work, we focus on structural problems resulting from forces that can occur when the object is standing or when it is held at probable locations, such as pedestals or appropriately sized handles. We then correct the model by using three different approaches: local thickening, strut adding, and hollowing. Local thickening increases the strength of the object’s thin parts, and it preserves the form and the surface detail of the object. Struts can be inserted to prevent nonrigid deformations of the object, and they are automatically placed at locations that are least visible to the user. Hollowing eliminates material inside the object, reducing the weight of certain parts to alleviate the stress at other locations. Hollowing may also lower the cost by reducing the amount of used material. The correction technique is chosen based on the visual impact on the result, and it can be further adjusted by user parameters. After a correction is made, the process repeats until all structural problems are eliminated. We show our technique on various objects, such as game characters or technical models. We measured the stress on original and corrected objects, and we experimentally veriﬁed that the corrected models are more robust. Our paper continues with a description of the overall schema of the system in Section 2.

corrections are (1) adding a strut (2) thickening some parts, or (3) hollowing some part of the model. Care is taken not to modify the model in a way that would cause a signiﬁcant visual alteration. The result is a modiﬁed triangular mesh with improved structural properties. In the following text, we discuss individual modules of the pipeline in detail. The structural problems of general objects are very complex because they depend on the material, printer, and the object itself; thus the complete solution is not within the scope of this paper. We present a general pipeline and a solution that can be applied to a wide variety of input models printed on an arbitrary 3D printer. Please note that the implementation of individual modules can be adjusted to provide better accuracy or to meet requirements that are speciﬁc to the used 3D printing technology or to the type of the printed object.

Figure 2: The overall schema of our method. The potential structural loads are generated and the object is repeatedly analyzed for structural problems that are corrected by one of the three proposed methods. The analysis stops when the stress is under a userspeciﬁed level.

Printability Analysis

Printing a 3D object is a complex process. Each printer manufacturer provides its own printer drivers that address some issues. For example, to print an object with concave or topologically disconnected parts, a support medium is introduced. Once the model has been printed, the support must be removed by blowing, melting, or washing. A successfully printed model must not only survive printing, but also subsequent handling during the cleanup phase and regular use. To perform printability analysis, we ﬁrst determine the most probable structural loads that the object may be subject to. Each load is deﬁned by a set of forces and constraints that are used for a physically based structural analysis of the object.

System Pipeline

Figure 2 shows the overall schema of our system. The input model is a triangular watertight mesh representing a 3D manifold that is analyzed to detect possible structural problems. We ﬁrst detect issues resulting from gravity acting on a standing object and from humans manipulating it by pressing the object at various handling points. The model is then iteratively evaluated and corrected. At each iteration the structural analysis module reports whether the stress is above the desired level, and the best model correction option is evaluated and chosen. The options for the structural model

It would be difﬁcult to determine all possible structural loads that a given object must withstand; thus we are looking only for the set of highly probable cases. We divide the loads into two categories: permanent and imposed. Permanent loads occur when the object is placed in a resting position on a ﬂat surface. It is deformed by gravity while its movement is constrained by the ﬂat plane where it rests. Imposed loads capture situations when the object is handled and is thus subject to both gravity and external forces. To determine the permanent loads we ﬁnd a set of orientations for which the object can be stably placed onto a ﬂat surface. Each orientation is tested to determine whether the model can support its own weight. We assume that the model’s default upright orientation is known. However, it may be automatically determined by the algorithm of Fu et al. [2008]. We ﬁnd a set of additional valid orientations for the object placement by closely

where we compare the grip axis direction lG,p to the average normal direction nAp on the grasped surface Ap . The size of the surface Ap is deﬁned by the average size of a human ﬁnger and its center is the position p of a given grasp site P . This ensures that we preferably choose grip conﬁgurations where the grasped surface is ﬂat and aligned with the grip axis. The accessibility of each site is then estimated using ambient occlusion OG (p). We select NG grip conﬁgurations with highest Λ while keeping them signiﬁcantly different from each other. Equation (1) would lead to similar Λ values for closely located grip conﬁgurations. For each selected grip conﬁguration Gs , we multiply the value of Λ for all remaining conﬁgurations with a penalty term dGi ,Gs , where dGi ,Gs is the average geodesic distance between grip sites. The force Fgrip of the grip is evaluated using an empirical model of [Kinoshita et al. 1997] that predicts the grip force based on the tangential force Ft and the tangential torque Tz on the ﬁngers holding the object: Fgrip = |Tz | Ft 0.011 + − Ft |Tz |, µi µrot µi (2)

following concepts detailed in [Fu et al. 2008]. We compute the convex hull of the object along with its center of mass (see Fig. 3). Each face of the convex hull represents a candidate orientation for placing the object on a ﬂat surface. We test each face by orthogonally projecting the center of mass onto the face plane. If the projected center falls outside the face, the conﬁguration is unstable. We sort the stable faces by their decreasing area and then move the default orientation to the head of the list. The area criterion provides a simple heuristic to prioritize the more likely orientations if the object were to be randomly placed down. The prioritized ordering allows test cases to be truncated into a smaller set when computing resources are limited. We note that the set of cases may be reduced further by exploiting symmetries. An object can be manipulated in many different ways. Because of the physical size of objects that are usually printed, we restrict ourselves to the analysis of loads generated by a pinch grip, where the object is grasped by two ﬁngers. Two-ﬁnger grips represent only a limited sub-set of possible handling conﬁgurations, but they are especially important for printability analysis because the forces applied to the model are higher when only two ﬁngers are used.
Imposed Loads

where µi and µrot are the coefﬁcients of linear and rotational friction, respectively, and their values are determined by the properties of the material. The tangential force is Ft = Fg (|lG × g|), where g is the direction of gravity and Fg is the gravitational force. The value of tangential torque depends on the relative positions of the grasp sites p1 and p2 to the center of mass of the object co as Tz = Fg i=1,2 lG · ((pi − co ) × g). Note that if the grip axis lG is parallel to g, both Ft and Tz are zero and the given grip requires no force. However, it is still important to test these conﬁgurations because the effects of gravity alone might be signiﬁcant, especially when lG is far away from the center of mass of the object. An example of the ﬁrst ﬁve detected pinch grips for a model of a kitten is shown in Fig. 4.

To further reduce the search space of grip conﬁgurations, we ﬁrst create a set of plausible grip positions that are then evaluated and from which the best ones are selected. To determine plausible grip positions, we ﬁrst mark each face center of the input mesh as a possible grasp site P1 for the ﬁrst ﬁnger. For each site P1 , we deﬁne a set of grip directions that determine the axis of a single pinch grip. The set of directions should represent the most natural ways by which a person would grasp the given object. As shown in [Balasubramanian et al. 2010], people tend to instinctively hold objects in such ways that the center of the mass is located either in the grip axis itself or somewhere on the plane deﬁned by the grip axis and the gravity vector. To ﬁnd such conﬁgurations for every site P1 , we deﬁne one grip direction that connects the site to the center of the object’s mass and one direction that points to the center of mass projected to a plane that is parallel to the ground level. Another common case is holding the object by some local feature, such as the handle of a cup. We capture these cases by creating a grip direction that points to the closest point on the medial axis to P1 , and we create one ray for each of these directions. We then ﬁnd all intersections of the ray with the object, and for each one we create a second grasp site P2 that, together with the given site P1 , forms a grip conﬁguration GP 1,P 2 . The above process results in a large number of possible grip conﬁgurations that is lessened by analyzing geometric properties of the grip conﬁgurations and checking how accessible they are for human

Structural Analysis

The structural stability of a printed model depends on the computed load cases and on the printing technology and material that are used. To make our approach applicable to a wide variety of 3D printing settings, we compute the stability from the solution of the linear elasticity problem considering a homogenous material. The accuracy of the structural analysis can be improved by using moreadvanced methods targeted at speciﬁc 3D printers and materials.

The input object is converted into a tetrahedral mesh using method in [Si 2011], and the stress is computed from the solution of the discrete linear elasticity problem using the Finite Element Method (FEM) with quadratic tetrahedral elements [Hughes 1987]: Kd = F, (3)

3.2.2

Stress Analysis

where K is the stiffness matrix and d is the deformation of the mesh caused by external and internal forces represented by F. The tetrahedral mesh and the material properties are used to compute the stiffness matrix K of the linear system that is reused for all load scenarios. Each load yields the boundary conditions and the right-hand side F as described in Section 3.2.1. The solution to the linear elasticity problem is a vector of deformations d of the input mesh under the given input conditions. The deformations are used to compute the strain and stress in the input mesh using Cauchy’s linear strain tensor and Hooke’s law, respectively. To determine the structural problems, we use the von Mises yield criterion [von Mises 1913] that speciﬁes the critical value of von Mises.
3.2.1 Analysis of Loads

Once all boundary conditions and forces are deﬁned, the system from Eq. (3) is solved and the deformation of the mesh is computed. The deformation is then used to solve the linear strain tensor ε and stress tensor σ: 1 ε = (( d)T + d) (6) 2 σ = Cε, (7) where C is the elasticity matrix that contains properties of the printed material. To compute the critical level of the stress, we use the von Mises yield criterion [von Mises 1913] that compares the von Mises stress σvm with a material-speciﬁc yield strength Sm . The value of von Mises stress is
2 2 2 (∆σ1,2 )2 + (∆σ2,3 )2 + (∆σ3,1 )2 + 6(σ12 + σ23 + σ31 ) , 2 (8) where ∆σi,j = σii − σjj . 2 σvm =

To solve the system in Eq. (3) for a given load scenario, we need to deﬁne the boundary conditions and the right-hand side F. The boundary conditions specify ﬁxed vertices of the tetrahedral mesh that have a prescribed deformation dv equal to zero. The righthand side F is computed from the body forces and external forces that affect the printed object, and it can be decomposed into the sum of elemental contributions F = f e that are deﬁned as fe =
Ωe

NT b dΩ +
Γe

NT t dΓ,

(4)

The critical level of the stress σc is then deﬁned as σc = λSm , where λ is a constant 0 < λ < 1 that speciﬁes the maximum allowed value of stress with respect to the yield strength of the material Sm . By decreasing the value of λ, we increase the sensitivity of our method so that it detects more printability problems but can lead to a generation of false positives. From our experiments, a value λ = 0.2 provides reasonable results. At the end, we compare the maximum value of the von Mises stress max σv with the maximum allowed critical stress σc . If the value of the von Mises stress is higher than the critical value, we say that the input object has a printability problem.

where Ωe is a tetrahedral element e, Γe is one face of the tetrahedron, N is the matrix of quadratic basis functions, b is the body force on the element (in our case only gravity), and t is the surface load at the given face of an element. Permanent loads are caused by gravity acting on an object standing on a ﬂat surface; therefore the ﬁxed vertices can be identiﬁed by locating all vertices that lie within some distance to the ﬂat surface. Also, the only force affecting the object is gravity (a body force b in Eq. (4)). The surface load t = 0 everywhere on the object. To compute the right-hand side F we need to integrate the gravity over each element Ωe . Since we use quadratic basis functions, an accurate integral can be computed using numerical integration based on the Gaussian quadrature rule [Golub and Welsch 1967]. Imposed loads are caused by two ﬁngers holding the object, subjecting the object to both gravity and external forces generated by the grip itself. We decompose the problem into two different cases: one to account for gravity without any external forces and one to analyze the pressure caused by the grip while ignoring the effects of gravity. The decomposition is necessary because the structural analysis method does not support friction, which forces us to ﬁx all grasped sites when testing the effects of gravity. The ﬁxed site then deﬁnes new boundary conditions of our system while the right-hand side is computed in the same way as for the permanent loads. When testing the pressure caused by the grip, we ﬁx all points that are grasped by one ﬁnger while we apply the entire required grip force vector Fgrip = Fgrip lG to all affected mesh faces ΓG that are located under the second grasp site. The load tτ that affects a given mesh face τ is computed from its size and orientation: tτ = Fgrip max(0, −nτ · Fgrip ) , γ∈Γg Aγ max(0, −nγ · Fgrip ) (5)

Printability Corrections

A detected printability problem indicates that it may be unsafe to print the object in its current state. To remove these problem, we reduce the stress in the input object so that it is below a given critical value σc that speciﬁes a potential structural failure of the used material by using local thickening, strut adding, and hollowing. The particular correction is automatically selected based on its impact on the visual appearance of the model and its effectiveness. First, we pick the structural load that is associated with the highest stress in the tested model. We then apply each of our model correction methods and generate a list of all possible corrections. There could be more than one suggested correction for each of the three methods. Every correction from the list is evaluated for its effece v tiveness δψ and for its impact on the appearance δψ . These factors are then used to compute the ﬁnal cost of each correction γ as
e v γ = wψ (we δψ + wv δψ ),

(9)

where wψ is a user-deﬁned weight of a given type of printability correction, and we and wv are weights deﬁning the importance of effectiveness and visual appearance, respectively. A correction with the lowest cost is then applied. For most of the analyzed objects, we used an equal weight wψ for all corrections, while the effectiveness and visual importance were set to we = 0.7 and wv = 0.3.

Medial Geometry Analysis

where A is the area of a given face and n is its normal.
ACM Transactions on Graphics, Vol. 31, No. 4, Article 48, Publication Date: July 2012

The results of the structural analysis are stored in a 3D tetrahedral grid that represents the object. In general, the structure of 3D objects can be complicated; therefore we reduce the degree of complexity of the problem by analyzing the computed stress on the medial axis of the object rather than on the object itself.

Figure 6: It is not sufﬁcient to apply thickening locally on highly stressed parts of the model (in red) (left) because the stress would be simply moved somewhere else (right).

Figure 7: To reduce the stress in the object (a), we identify the linear chains of the medial axis with an excessive stress. (b). The part of the component that must be thickened is determined by the value of the stress and by the distance of individual vertices from the medial points of the component (c). The thickness of the component together with the stress is used to compute a thickening correction (d). We limit the length of components that can be thinned by nonmanifold junctions in the medial axis as shown in Fig. 7 and by the threshold thickness that separates a given thin part from thick parts. To compute the threshold thickness, we take the location of the maximal stress σm and ﬁnd its closest medial point. Based on the local thickness tm associated with the medial point, we can then compute a new thickness td that would reduce the stress to the allowed critical value σc . Since most of the problematic components resemble thin tubes, we simplify the situation by assuming that the component has a beam shape with a circular cross-section. If needed, this approximation can be improved by detecting the actual cross-section of the component at the point with the highest stress. Using the second modulus of a cross-section, it can be shown that the stress σ caused by bending forces on a beam is directly related to the thickness t of the cross-section as σ = cb /t3 , (10)

We ﬁrst construct an approximate medial axis for both the interior and exterior of the object following the method described in Dey and Zhao [2003]. The medial axis is prone to include minor surface perturbations, which may result in many extraneous branches that often correspond to insigniﬁcant surface details. We remove these branches using a topology-preserving pruning based on a separation angle strategy as described in Liu et al. [2010]. The value of the separation angle can be used to deﬁne the size of the surface detail that we want to preserve. Lastly, we compute the maximal stress for every medial point on the interior medial axis by gathering the maximum stress value from its associated nearest tetrahedrons (see Fig. 5).

4.2

Local Thickening

Many of the structural problems are caused by excessive stress in thin parts of the printed object that can easily break or fracture. The goal of local thickening is to identify and ﬁx the problematic thin parts of the model. We ﬁrst identify candidate parts for thickening. The excessive stress is often concentrated only in a limited volume, but in general it is not sufﬁcient to thicken the mesh only around the stressed areas, because such an operation would only move the stress somewhere else (see Fig. 6). To solve this problem, we must identify the entire thin component that should be thickened as a whole. When such a component is thickened, the stress is redistributed evenly across its entire volume, which effectively reduces the stress below the critical value. Also, a small thickening of a large part of the model has a smaller visual impact than excessive modiﬁcation of a local part.
Component Analysis

where cb is a constant value speciﬁc for a given position at the beam that is independent to the local thickness t. Please note that this relation is valid only when the beam is subject to bending forces, and it does not hold for general cases. However, most cases that will be encountered when handling a printed object would result either in bending forces or axial forces. Axial forces usually result in lower stress than bending forces, thus thickening the surface enough to reduce the bending forces sufﬁciently reduces stress to also cover axial forces. We can then use Eq. (10) to determine the target thickness td as td = tm

σm /σc .

(11)

To determine which part of the mesh should be considered a thin component, we need to take into account the value of the stress that we want to reduce. When the stress is high, we need to thicken larger parts of the model than when the stress is less. We use combined information about the stress and about the local thickness and topology that is stored on the computed interior medial axis, as described in Section 4.1.

The threshold thickness tt that separates the thin part from the thick parts is deﬁned as tt = ct td , where ct is a predeﬁned constant (we set ct = 1.1 in all our examples). We then compute the set of points on the medial axis that are bounded by the threshold thickness. The surface region corresponding to these medial points deﬁnes the thin components of the mesh.

Mesh Displacement To make a given thin component thicker, we displace the original mesh away from the medial axis. We displace only vertices whose distance tv to the nearest medial point on the thin component is less than tt . The amount of displacement of the given vertex is computed as dv = (tt − tv )/2, where tt is the threshold thickness of the given component.

The target offset surface can be generated using many existing techniques, such as level sets [Cohen et al. 1996; Peng et al. 2004]. However, these methods do not preserve small surface details that are important for the visual appearance of the models. To solve this issue, we displace individual vertices away from their nearest medial points. To avoid self-intersections, we displace the vertices along a smooth distance ﬁeld that is computed as a solution to Laplace’s equation on a tetrahedral grid that discretizes space within the exterior medial axis of the object. The grid contains a single point for each medial vertex and for each surface vertex of the mesh. All of these vertices are then used to deﬁne the boundary conditions of Laplace’s equation, using their distance to the nearest internal medial point. The system is then solved using the ﬁnite element method with quadratic tetrahedral elements. The displacement is equal to traversal of the resulting distance ﬁeld, which is implemented using the Runge-Kutta integration method [Butcher 2008]. The traversal ends when a given vertex reaches the distance v equal to t2 + dv .
Thickening Evaluation The input model may contain several thin components that are subject to excessive stress. Although we might thicken the components one by one, but that might not always lead to the best structural and visual results. If we have several problematic thin components, and if we thicken only one, the thickened component might gather some stress from the remaining others. This can lead to uneven thickening of different components, even if their initial parameters are the same. Therefore when we evaluate the thickening corrections, we compute the cost of all combinations of nonoverlapping thickenings.
e The effectiveness of a thickening correction δt that consists of nt nonoverlapping thickenings is computed as e t δt = wσ i<nt

Figure 8: An imposed pressure load caused an excessive stress in the material (left). The search space for possible struts is limited by a part of exterior medial axis (purple color) that automatically identiﬁes all concave parts of the input model for possible connections by a strut (right). For our experiments, we used nv = 5 different directions sampled over the hemisphere deﬁned by the upright position of the object: one direction pointing up and the remaining four uniformly distributed along a circle deﬁned by a polar angle π/4. We found that t t the default setting of wrc = 0.3 and wrc = 0.7 produced good results.

where σc is the critical stress as deﬁned in Section 3.2.2. The value of σti is the current maximal stress on the thickened component i, and Vti is the new volume added to the original volume of the comt t ponent Vci . wσ and wV are user-deﬁned weights that determine the importance of stress reduction compared to the new volume of the t t thickening. In our examples, we used wσ = 0.8 and wV = 0.2. The visual impact of a thickening on the appearance of the object can be determined from the changes in the visual proﬁle of the thickened component. We deﬁne the visual proﬁle as the average visible area from several predeﬁned directions. To compute the proﬁle, we render the scene from a set of nv view directions, and we measure the number of pixels that were rendered for the given component. For the evaluation, we measure the visual proﬁle of the original object ro , of the thin component rc , and of the thickened component rc . The visual impact of one thickening is then computed as

The local thickening can be effectively used to solve many of the structural problems of the printed objects, but in certain cases, the thin components that cause the printability issues are essential for the object’s visual style. When they are made noticeably thicker, the objects might be visually altered too much. Also, the local thickening is sometimes unfeasible from a practical point of view, such as when the printed object consists of many interconnected thin components, and to remove the stress, we would need to thicken the whole object. Our second model correction technique attempts to solve these problems by adding supporting structures, that is, struts. Unlike local thickening that thickens affected components, the struts are designed to remove the stress by addressing its cause, which is a nonrigid deformation in the object. Our method automatically places struts between parts that are deformed, which moves the stress from the problematic parts into the struts. We can usually ﬁnd many different struts that would effectively reduce the stress in the input object. The suitability of each strut depends on several factors, including its visibility, thickness, length, and many others (see below for more details). To ﬁnd a good location for a strut, we ﬁrst detect a set of all plausible strut locations and we evaluate them to select the best ones.

Struts are essentially new, straight connections between two parts of the object, which means that they can be constructed only in exterior concave regions of the input objects;otherwise, drawing nonintersecting line between end points of a strut would be impossible. The concave regions can be directly identiﬁed from the exterior medial axis, as described in Section 4.1. The exterior medial axis deﬁnes sheets that every strut must intersect, which greatly reduces the search space for possible struts (Fig. 8). The struts can intersect the medial axis at any point and angle. To obtain a ﬁnite number of struts, we ﬁnd a subset of medial points using a uniform sampling of the medial axis. Each point from this

subset deﬁnes a set of struts that pass through the point at a few predeﬁned angles. The angles are computed from the normal vector on the medial sheet and from the normal and deformation vectors of the closest mesh vertices. Some of these struts may not be valid, since they can point outside of the object. Therefore for every medial point and every angle, we shoot a ray in both directions and we check whether it intersects the input object. The intersection points are the end points of a strut. In our examples we generated nine uniformly distributed directions for every medial point. We generate additional struts by shooting rays from the end points of the struts that are passing the medial points. The direction of these rays corresponds to the direction of the deformation of the mesh surface at the given point that is obtained from the structural analysis as explained in Section 3.2. The struts obtained from these rays act, in general, against the normal deformations of the object while they minimize the effects of skew deformations, which are unwanted because they can easily break the struts. The thickness of a strut depends on the strength and orientation of forces that act on its end points. Unfortunately these forces are unknown and cannot be directly computed from the known displacement of the input object. Therefore we use an approximate solution that usually leads to good results, noting that if the computed thickness is insufﬁcient, it would be thickened by the local thickening correction later on.
Strut Thickness

consideration the direction of forces acting on the end points of the strut. Although these forces are unknown, we can still estimate their directions from the computed displacement d of the analyzed object. To evaluate the locations pF p and directions Fdp of forces affecting a given strut end point p, we compute a weighted sum of all displacements of the medial points that are within some threshold distance εd to the medial point associated with the point p. The volume of the object that is considered during evaluation of the effectiveness of the strut is determined by εd . The amount of supported volume mostly depends on the geodesic distance νs between the two end points of the strut; therefore we set εd = νs /4. Fdp is then decomposed into normal component Fnp and tangential component Ftp with respect to the direction of the strut. Furthermore if the normal force is eccentric with respect to the position of the strut, we need to compute the bending moment Mbp = (pc − pF p ) × Fnp , where pc is the midpoint of the strut. The total strength of normal force that affects the strut is then Fns = Fnp0 − Fnp1 , the strength of tangential force is Fts = Ftp0 − Ftp1 , and the total moment is Mbs = Mbp0 + Mbp1 . We then evaluate the efﬁciency of a given strut as
e s δs = wσ

σc Mbs + Fts s Vs + wV , σm Fns Vo

(14)

To compute the thickness, we ﬁrst ﬁnd the most stressed medial point that lies on a geodesic path along the medial axis between the two end points of the strut. The stress value σm and the thickness at the selected medial point is then used to compute a new desired thickness of the component using Eq. (11). We use this thickness as the thickness of the strut, which usually leads to a structurally stable correction no matter the nature of forces affecting the ends of the strut.

where σm is the maximal stress detected between two end-points of the strut, Vs is the volume of the strut, and Vo is the volume of the printed object. Both factors can be weighted by users, similar s to the Eq. (12). In our examples we used wσ = 0.8 while the effect s of the volume was only wV = 0.2. The visual impact of a strut is deﬁned as
v s δs = wvi Os

Vs , Vo

(15)

where Os is the visibility of a given strut. We approximate the visibility by computing the ambient occlusion on several sample points on a surface of each strut. Because struts are visually more disturbing than other corrections, we set the weight of the visual s importance to wvi = 2. An example of selecting different struts based on varying weights is shown in Fig. 9. When a strut is selected to correct the input object, its geometric representation must be created, and it must then be attached to the original mesh. The geometry of a strut is a tube with both ends open and skewed according to the normal vector at the target surface. Each open end of the tube is then projected to the surface, and faces within a predeﬁned geodesic distance to the projected area are removed from the mesh. This creates an open hole in the original mesh that must be connected to the end of the tube by generating a new triangulation of the open space between the two open holes. To do so, we ﬁrst embed both holes into a circle as described in [Schmidt and Singh 2010]. Both circles are then projected to a single plane, and a new triangulation is created using the algorithm proposed by [Shewchuk 2001]. Vertices belonging to the open holes are then projected back to the global space. The remaining new interior vertices of the connections are then smoothed by solving a linear bi-Laplacian system [Andrews et al. 2011] that is constrained by the positions and tangent vectors of the vertices that belong to the open holes.

Hollowing

We estimate the thickness of a strut independent of the forces that affect its end points, but in reality the efﬁciency of a strut is heavily inﬂuenced by its orientation and position. In general, struts that are subject to axial forces are more stable compared to similar struts that must withstand many bending forces. Therefore to evaluate the efﬁciency of a strut, we take into

Should the excessive stress emerge during testing of the gravity effects of both permanent and imposed loads, we know that the source of the stress must be the gravity force. Because the strength of the gravity force depends on the mass of the object, we try to reduce its effects by reducing the mass of the printed object.

Problems caused by gravity usually emerge when we have a thick component that is supported by thin components that cannot hold its weight. Therefore we ﬁrst use the maximal value of stress in the model to identify thin components, applying the same method as described in Section 4.2. All the remaining parts of the model are then considered thick components.

boundary constraint. Once the distance ﬁeld is computed, we normalize the computed values based on thollow of the nearest medial point to the given grid point. Lastly, we construct a new mesh that represents the hole using a marching tetrahedron method for an isosurface with a value equal to 1.

Figure 11: To create a hollowing correction, we compute a distance ﬁeld on the object’s interior using Laplace’s equation bounded by the medial points of the hollowed component and the vertices of the mesh (a). Marching tetrahedrons creates a new triangular mesh that represents the hole (b), and the mesh is simpliﬁed and applied to the object (c.) Note that most 3D printing technologies use an additional material to support the layers during printing of the object, and it is quite likely that there would be some support material inside the hollowed part. We need to add a small hole or holes into the structure so that the support material can be cleaned or melted. Such holes can be added manually before the support material is cleaned. Lastly, hollowing can signiﬁcantly affect the location of the center of mass of the printed object. If the hollowing makes the object unstable in its upright position, we automatically discard it and proceed with the next best model correction. Hollowing has no visual impact on the appearance of the printed model. We evaluated hollowing as follows:
Hollowing Evaluation
e h δh = w σ

Figure 10: Different loads might lead to different hollowing solutions. If we hold the object by the top, only the bottom components are hollowed (left). On the other hand, if the object sits on a surface all spherical components are hollowed while the pedestal remains intact (right). To learn which parts should be hollowed, we select the thin component with the highest value of stress and traverse the graph of thin and thick components, adding all visited components to a marked list. We do not allow traversal over any other thin components that are subject to an excessive level of stress. If some marked component reaches a ﬁxed part of the tested load (ﬂoor surface or hold positions), we remove all connected marked components from the list. The remaining marked thick components are then hollowed (see Fig. 10). The amount of hollowing is deﬁned on every medial point vm of the marked thick components by their hollowing thickness thollow (vm ). The thickness is determined by the amount of volume that we want to remove from the thick components. Since in general the stress scales linearly with the amount of applied force, we can compute the hollowing thickness as thollow (vm ) = min t(vm ) − tmin , t(vm ) 3 1 − σc σm , (16)

σc Vt , σm Vh

(17)

where Vh is the actual volume of removed material, and Vt is the target volume that we wanted to remove to reduce the stress below the critical stress σc . The target volume is directly proportional to σc the amount of stress that we want to reduce as Vt = Vo σm . Since hollowing is a preferred solution to most gravity-related issues, we h set its importance as wσ = 3.

Shape Optimization

where t(vm ) is the current thickness on the given medial point, tmin is some minimal allowed thickness of the printed material, and σm is the maximal stress in the object. The hollowing itself follows a modiﬁed approach that was used for mesh displacement as explained in Section 4.2. Similarly, we compute a distance ﬁeld using Laplace’s equation, but with different boundary conditions. For hollowing, the interior medial points that belong to the marked thick components bound the Laplace’s equation by their thickness, and all mesh vertices deﬁne a zero thickness
ACM Transactions on Graphics, Vol. 31, No. 4, Article 48, Publication Date: July 2012

The above-mentioned model correction techniques are essentially heuristics that aim to reduce the amount of excessive stress under the critical value while maintaining the visual appearance of the input model. A general solution to this problem could be achieved by using so-called shape optimization techniques. The goal of these methods is to ﬁnd the optimal geometry and topology of an input shape that minimizes certain objective function such as compliance [Allaire 2004] or the total stress in a shape [Allaire and Jouve 2008]. In our case, the goal would be to optimize the shape so that it minimizes the amount of excessive stress under the given load conditions while minimizing the visual difference from the original input model. As shown in [Allaire 2004], shape optimization problems can be solved iteratively using the gradient descent algorithm, where at each iteration the shape of the input model is deformed along the derivative of the objective function. The output of the algorithm is then an optimally corrected model that can be safely printed.

The main limitation of the shape optimization methods is their computational cost. To accurately evaluate the gradient of the objective function, we need to solve the linear elasticity problem whenever the shape of the model is changed. To do so we need to recompute the tetrahedral mesh, build a new stiffness matrix, and solve the resulting system. All of these steps are computationally expensive and would need be performed during every iteration of the optimization process. This would make the method too slow for even moderately complex input models. Furthermore, shape optimization methods can lead to topology changes that are difﬁcult to handle using our mesh-based approach. Allaire et al. [2004] proposed a new shape optimization approach that relies on level-set deformations of the initial shape [Osher and Sethian 1988] that automatically handles changing topologies. This approach also provides a performance beneﬁt because the simulation mesh for linear elasticity remains constant, as deﬁned by the underlying Eulerian grid. Unfortunately, to accurately represent the detail that can be produced by the modern 3D printers, a very ﬁne resolution grid with millions of elements would need be used. Our approach is a compromise between the speed and the output quality. We leave the research of a feasible shape optimization for printability corrections for future work. However, if a better or different solution is developed, it can be readily added into our pipeline.

Figure 12: A banana model printed without optimizations is quite likely to break because of very thin legs. An optimized model with an added strut shows much more structural strength. issue and suggested the structure be locally thickened along this weak spot. The thicker neck was then able to withstand the pressure caused by the grip, the correction did not leave any signiﬁcant impact on the visual appearance of the model. The example in Fig. 15 illustrates hollowing. A hollowed model of a bunny consumed signiﬁcantly less material than the full version (56%) and was also lighter. To maintain structural strength, our system also added six inner struts, as can be seen in Fig. 15 left. Hollowing has no additional effect on visual appearance. In conclusion, to correct a model of a dragon (Fig. 1), our system used all three types of corrections. First, the system detected that the neck cannot withstand the weight of the rest of the body when the model is held by the head. The ﬁrst ﬁx was to hollow the main body, but even though the stress decreased by approximately 25%, the remaining stress was still above the allowed limit. The stress on the neck was fully removed after thickening was applied. Then another problem emerged when the model was tested standing on a ﬂat surface. The object is too front-heavy, causing twisting and bending deformation on the legs, and this resulted in dangerous stress levels. The problem was automatically solved by ﬁxing the body of the dragon to the pedestal with a strut connected to the dragon’s tail. Table 1 lists the models we have used, the number of polygons representing them, the types of correction, the maximum and average stress of the model before and after correction, and the weight of used material, also before and after the correction. The reduction of the maximum stress indicates how well we ﬁxed the problematic area, and the average stress indicates whether we did not increase the overall stress, for example, because of hollowing. We are less concerned with average stress, since we focus on making the weakest parts of the model stronger.

Results

We evaluated our methods practically by printing our objects using two 3D printers: the ObjetTM Alaris30 desktop printer and the ObjetTM Eden350V professional printer. Both printers use the same printing pattern: the object is built by assembling thin layers of material (thickness of one layer can be from 16 to 28 microns). Average printing time was 18 hours with three objects, and tray size was 300x200x150mm. The building process uses two kinds of material: primary and support. As a primary material, we used VeroWhiteTM rigid opaque material and FullCure 720TM transparent one. Both materials are based on liquid polymers that solidify when exposed to UV light. After solidiﬁcation they have plastic-like structure with tensile strength equal to 50MPa. Support material has a gel-like structure and helps to support the incomplete object during printing. After printing, the support material is washed away using a high pressure (up to 12MPa) water jet nozzle. The cleaning process proved to be dangerous to printed models with thin parts because the high pressure of the water jet can easily break them, as happened, for example, in our banana model (Fig. 12), whose left arm broke during cleaning. When we used our system to improve our input models, all three methods were used: struts, thickening and hollowing. In all cases, structural strength of the models improved signiﬁcantly, and printed models were more resistant to permanent and imposed loads. Figure 12 shows an object that is unstable after printing and can be easily broken because of very thin legs. Structural analysis showed too much stress on the legs, and our system suggested adding a strut at the back of the model. Subsequent analysis showed that the strut was sufﬁcient to alleviate the stress. We were able to conﬁrm this by printing a new version of the model, which proved to be stable. Another example of adding struts is in Fig. 13. Although the model of a soccer cup is able to stand still, it deforms easily when grabbed by the supports that hold the ball. To relieve the stress, the system iteratively added ﬁve interconnecting struts that created bridges between individual supports. Note that the struts are introduced in areas where they have the least visual impact. Figure 14 shows a model created using the SporeTM video game that has a weak spot on the neck. This causes the head of the model to break off when the object is grabbed by the head and tail. Our system detected this

Our method automatically connects all parts of the handle together by means of ﬁve different struts (b). ough evaluation of grip positions on the object that can vary for different objects and users, among other things. Another area of improvement is structural analysis. The structural analysis presented in this paper works accurately only when the used material is homogenous and rigid. In reality, many of the used materials are plastic with nonhomogeneous properties caused by the layering of the material during printing. New printers can also print multiple materials at the same time, which is not directly supported by our method. Such situations require more advanced structural analysis as well as model speciﬁcation. Improving the accuracy and precision with a better physical simulation can enhance our results by providing greater predictability. Next, although we try to limit the visual impact of the model correction methods, we note that some of the corrections, especially struts, might alter the visual appearance of the printed object more than desired. The visual impact of struts can be reduced if their geometry and shape follow the visual style of the printed object. A detailed user study should be done to determine which structural changes are acceptable for which class of objects. We can speculate that adding struts to objects representing living objects will be less tolerated than doing the same for art objects. Although our method generates good results for most tested cases, some scenarios remain that are not captured efﬁciently. First of all, we do not detect structural problems that might arise when the

If the cleaning is done by melting the support material away in hot water, for example, there is no additional stress. However, some cleaning involves the use of a water stream that may add more stress to some parts. Evaluation of such stresses should be further investigated. Lastly, our current system is limited to the analysis and correction of static models. Many CAD-type models may have movable parts such as hinges, joints, wheels, bearings, and cogs. It is important not only to evaluate stress in the various conﬁgurations, but also to ensure that any corrections do not constrain the intended motion of the model. Especially important is taking into account a model’s de-

Conclusions

We have detailed an automatic system for both detecting and correcting 3D printability issues in static models. To our knowledge, our work is the ﬁrst to combine both physically based analysis with automatic geometric corrections in a single uniﬁed system for improving printability. We believe that our system aids both novices and experts in resolving issues prior to costly printing (both in time and money). Such technology is increasingly important as 3D printers become available for consumers. Although our work provides a strong foundation, we identiﬁed several challenging future research directions in the area of 3D printability.
