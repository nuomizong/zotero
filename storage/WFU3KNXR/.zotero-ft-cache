In this paper, we present the MITC3+ shell ﬁnite element for geometric nonlinear analysis and demonstrate its performance. The MITC3+ shell element, recently proposed for linear analysis [1], represents a further development of the MITC3 shell element. The total Lagrangian formulation is employed allowing for large displacements and large rotations. Considering several analysis problems, the nonlinear solutions using the MITC3+ shell element are compared with those obtained using the MITC3 and MITC4 shell elements. We conclude that the MITC3+ shell element shows, in the problems considered, the same excellent performance in geometric nonlinear analysis as already observed in linear analysis.

1. Introduction Due to signiﬁcant efforts over the past decades, the ﬁnite element method has become a powerful tool for the linear and nonlinear analyses of shell structures [2]. The available capabilities have been continuously improved in reliability and effectiveness but there are still important research and development tasks to be accomplished. One such task is the development of an optimal 3-node shell element. When modeling complex shell structures, an effective mesh of triangular shell elements is relatively easy to generate provided general element shapes are allowed, that is, the element employed must be effective even when used in general triangular shapes. Lee et al. proposed recently the 3-node MITC3+ shell element for linear analysis that was shown to perform even well when highly distorted elements are used [1]. Hence this element is a good candidate for use in general meshes. Of course, a shell surface can also be meshed rather easily using 4-node quadrilateral elements, but then in general practical analysis quite distorted elements might be present that show low predictive capabilities. Namely, quadrilateral elements generally do not perform well when highly distorted. It is difﬁcult to develop effective shell ﬁnite elements that give reliable and efﬁcient solutions for general shell problems, when considering the various shell geometries, boundary and loading conditions, and mesh patterns used [2–4]. The difﬁculty is basically

due to the highly sensitive and complex behavior of shell structures (categorized as bending dominated, membrane dominated and mixed behaviors), in particular, when the shell thickness is small [3,4]. Then a shell ﬁnite element discretization frequently gives too stiff solutions. This phenomenon is called ‘‘locking’’, which must be alleviated for reliable shell ﬁnite element analysis. Among various schemes to alleviate the locking, the MITC (Mixed Interpolation of Tensorial Components) scheme has been used very successfully in the development of general shell elements [1–7]. The MITC3+ shell element is based on the concepts of the MITC3 shell element developed by Lee and Bathe [6] with an enrichment by a cubic bubble function for the rotations. The cubic bubble function provides a higher-order interpolation inside the element to enrich the element behavior while maintaining the linear interpolation along the element edges. The degrees of freedom corresponding to the bubble function can be statically condensed out on the element level. To alleviate shear locking, a newly developed assumed transverse shear strain ﬁeld is used. The shell element passes the basic numerical tests – the isotropy, zero energy mode and patch tests – and shows an excellent convergence behavior in linear analysis. A particular strength of the MITC approach is that a formulation achieved for linear analysis can be directly extended to nonlinear analysis by ‘‘simply’’ using the appropriate stress and strain measures [2], although the performance in nonlinear solutions must then of course still be studied. Our objective in this paper is to present the formulation of the MITC3+ shell element in geometric nonlinear analysis. The standard total Lagrangian formulation is employed allowing for large

displacements and large rotations [2]. Solving various shell problems, the performance of the MITC3+ shell element is evaluated by comparison of the solution accuracies obtained with the MITC3+, MITC3 and MITC4 shell elements. Of course, the MITC4 quadrilateral shell element has been, and is, widely employed in

engineering practice due to its superior performance in both linear and nonlinear analyses. Our study reveals that the performance of the MITC3+ shell element in nonlinear analysis is as good as the performance of the MITC4 shell element, even when highly distorted meshes are used. Next, in Section 2, the linear formulation of the MITC3+ shell element is reviewed and, in Section 3, we present the geometric nonlinear formulation. In Section 4, we examine the performance of the MITC3+ shell element in geometric nonlinear analysis through the solutions of various shell problems. 2. The MITC3+ shell element for linear analysis In this section, we brieﬂy review the formulation of the MITC3+ shell element for linear analysis [1]. The two key aspects of the MITC3+ shell element are the geometry and displacement interpolations and the assumed covariant transverse shear strain ﬁelds.

Unlike the standard 3-node shell elements, the MITC3+ shell element has an internal node and the corresponding cubic bubble function in the geometry interpolation. From Eq. (1), the displacement interpolation of the MITC3+ shell element for linear analysis is obtained by [1]

The interior node, with rotation degrees of freedom only, is positioned on the ﬂat surface deﬁned by the three corner nodes of the element. Only the bending and transverse shear strain ﬁelds are enriched by the bubble function, and the geometry of the element remains ﬂat, as for the MITC3 element, in a large deformation analysis. Of course, static condensation can be carried out on the element level for the rotations a4 and b4, and hence in practice the element is really a 3-node element. 2.2.

The MITC3+ shell element for geometric nonlinear analysis In this section, we present the geometric nonlinear formulation of the MITC3+ shell element. The total Lagrangian formulation is employed allowing for large displacements and large rotations. In the formulation, a superscript (and subscript) t is used to denote ‘‘time’’ for general analysis, with in static solutions ‘‘time’’ simply denoting the load step and conﬁguration [2]. We discuss below the large displacement kinematics and the interpolation of the Green–Lagrange strain components. With the given expressions, the now classical incremental equations used in the total Lagrangian formulation can directly be established [2]. 3.1.

If d = 0 is used, there is one spurious zero eigenvalue for a single element, which however disappears as soon as two elements are used in the mesh. The MITC3+ shell element is based on the ‘basic mathematical shell model’ [4,8,9] and the MITC scheme. The element passes the basic numerical tests, namely, the isotropy, zero energy mode, and patch tests. Furthermore, the MITC3+ shell element shows an

4. Numerical examples To assess the performance of the MITC3+ shell element in geometric nonlinear analysis, the solutions of several benchmark problems are given in this section. The problems involve the large displacement and large rotation response of shells with various shell geometries. The results calculated using the following MITC shell elements are given  MITC3: 3-node triangular shell element  MITC3+: 3-node triangular shell element enriched by a cubic bubble function (presented in this paper)  MITC4: 4-node quadrilateral shell element In each example, the reference solutions are given by either an analytical result or a calculated solution using a ﬁne uniform mesh of the MITC9 shell element (these meshes used twice the number of elements in each direction as employed in the MITC4 element solutions) [11]. The MITC9 element is known to satisfy the ellipticity and consistency conditions and to show good convergence behavior [5,11,12]. For comparison, we also plot the results of the linear analysis calculated using the MITC9 shell element. The

iterations to solve the nonlinear equations have been performed in each load step to a convergence tolerance of 0.1 percent on the relative incremental energy. Note that in some benchmark problems, point loads are used, which cause a stress singularity at the point of loading. However, the use of point loads is acceptable in the studies here given because the meshes are not very ﬁne (the point loads act as an equivalent pressure applied over a small area) [2]. 4.1. Cantilever plate subjected to end shear force The cantilever plate shown in Fig. 3(a) is subjected to a shear force at the free end. This problem has been considered many times before, see e.g. [13-15]. The material properties, geometry and applied force are chosen as E = 1.2 Â 106, v = 0, L = 10, B = 1, h = 0.1 and Pmax = 4. Fig. 3(b) shows the 16 Â 1 mesh used for the solution with the MITC4 shell element and the corresponding mesh used for the MITC3 and MITC3+ shell elements. The reference

solutions are calculated using a 32 Â 2 element mesh of the MITC9 shell element. Fig. 4 shows the calculated load–displacement curves. Fig. 5 depicts the deformed conﬁgurations of the cantilever plate obtained using the MITC3+ shell element at various load levels (P = 0.25Pmax, 0.5Pmax, 0.75Pmax, and Pmax). All shell elements considered show excellent performance in the solution of this problem. 4.2. Cantilever plate subjected to end moment Fig. 6 shows the cantilever plate subjected to a moment at the free end. This is a good problem to test the large rotation capability of shell elements [16-19]. The cantilever plate has length L = 12, width B = 1, thickness h = 0.1, Young’s modulus E = 1.2 Â 106 and Poisson’s ratio v = 0. We use the end moment Mmax = 2pM0 with M0 = EI/L, and hence the cantilever rolls up into a complete circle. The structure is modeled using a 16 Â 1 element mesh of the

MITC4 shell element and the corresponding MITC3 and MITC3+ shell element meshes, see Fig. 3(b). The reference solutions are calculated using a 32 Â 2 element mesh of the MITC9 shell element. The cantilever forms a circular arc of radius R given by the classical formula R = EI/M. Thus, the analytical tip displacements are derived as

0.2Mmax, 0.3Mmax, . . ., Mmax). All computed results show good agreement with the analytical solutions. 4.3. Slit annular plate under end shear force We examine here a slit annular plate, as shown in Fig. 9(a). This example was suggested by Basar and Ding [20] and has been ß widely considered [16,19,21-25]. The geometry and elastic material properties are given by Ri = 6, Re = 10, h = 0.03, E = 21 Â 106 and v = 0. The transverse shear force Pmax = 3.2 is incrementally applied at one end of the slit while the other end of the slit is fully clamped. The plate undergoes large displacements and large

The reference solutions are obtained using a 12 Â 60 element mesh of the MITC9 shell element. The load–displacement curves at two different points, A and B, are depicted in Fig. 10. The deformed conﬁgurations calculated using the MITC4, MITC3 and MITC3+ shell elements are shown in Fig. 11. As seen, the MITC3 shell element displays too stiff a behavior. However, the results using the MITC3+ shell element are in

agreement with those using the MITC4 shell element and reasonably close to the reference solutions. 4.4. Hemispherical shell subjected to alternating radial forces Here we consider a hemispherical shell with an 18 circular cutout, as shown in Fig. 12(a). The shell is pinched along one direction at points B and D and pulled along the perpendicular direction at points A and C [13,15,23,24,26]. The material and geometric properties are given by E = 6.825 Â 107, v = 0.3, R = 10, and the thickness

is 0.04. The point load is incrementally applied to a maximum value Pmax = 400. The shell is modeled using 8 Â 32 and 12 Â 48 element meshes of the MITC4 shell element and the corresponding MITC3 and MITC3+ shell element meshes, see Fig. 12(b). A 24 Â 96 element mesh of the MITC9 shell element is used to obtain the reference solutions. Fig. 13 shows the load-radial displacement curves at the loaded points A and B. The deformed conﬁgurations obtained using a 8 Â 32 element mesh of the MITC4 shell element and the corresponding MITC3 and MITC3+ shell element meshes are shown in Fig. 14. For the meshes used, the MITC4 and MITC3+ shell elements produce much better solution accuracy than the MITC3 shell element in this problem. 4.5. Clamped semi-cylindrical shell under point load

Fig. 16 gives the obtained load–displacement curves, and Fig. 17 shows the deformed shapes calculated using the 20 Â 20 element mesh of the MITC3+ shell ﬁnite elements at various load levels, P = Pmax/3, 2Pmax/3, and Pmax. The three shell elements show good performance in the solution of this shell problem with the meshes used. We then perform the analysis with the distorted mesh patterns shown in Fig. 18. For an N Â N element mesh, each edge is discretized with the following ratio: L1: L2:L3:. . .LN = 1:2:3:. . .N. The solutions are obtained with a 24 Â 24 element mesh of the MITC4, MITC3 and MITC3+ shell elements. Fig. 19 shows the calculated load–displacement curves when the distorted mesh patterns in Fig. 18 are used. The MITC3+ shell element shows a good performance regardless of which mesh pattern in Fig. 18(b) is used. 4.6. Fully clamped plate under uniform pressure

A well-known benchmark problem for geometric nonlinear analysis of shells is the semi-cylindrical shell under a point load shown in Fig. 15(a) [16,19,21,27]. The length and radius of the half cylinder are L = 0.3048 and R = 1.016, respectively, and the thickness is h = 0.03; the material constants are E = 2.0685 Â 107 and v = 0.3. The load applied to the shell increases up to Pmax = 2000. The structure is modeled using 20 Â 20 and 32 Â 32 element meshes of the MITC4 shell element and the corresponding MITC3 and MITC3+ shell element meshes, see Fig. 15(b). The reference solutions are obtained using a 64 Â 64 element mesh of the MITC9 shell element.

Fig. 20 shows the fully clamped plate under uniform pressure [14,17,22,26,28,29]. A square plate of dimensions 2L Â 2L and uniform thickness h is considered and all edges are fully clamped with the hard boundary condition [2]. Due to symmetry, only one-quarter of the plate is modeled, with the following boundary conditions: ux = hy = 0 along BC, uy = hx = 0 along DC and ux = uy = hx = hy = 0 along AB and AD. The material properties used are E = 1.7472 Â 103 and v = 0.3. The pressure applied to the plate increases up to qmax = h3 Â 105. The length of the plate is L = 1 and four different plate thicknesses (h/L = 1/10, 1/100, 1/1,000

and 1/10,000) are considered. This problem is modeled using a 10 Â 10 element mesh of the MITC4 shell element and the corresponding MITC3 and MITC3+ shell element meshes. The reference solutions are calculated using a 20 Â 20 element mesh of the MITC9 shell element. Fig. 21 shows the calculated vertical displacement at point C versus the uniform pressure. The solutions using the MITC3 shell element deteriorate as the shell thickness decreases due to shear locking. However, the MITC3+ and MITC4 shell ﬁnite elements show excellent results compared to the reference solutions. We also consider the same problem with the distorted 4 Â 4 element mesh shown in Fig. 22 when h/L = 1/100. In the distorted element meshes, each edge is divided by the ratio: L1:L2:L3:L4 = 1:2:3:4. Fig. 23 shows the calculated load–displacement curves. The MITC3+ and MITC4 shell elements show an excellent performance even when the distorted meshes are used. It is also observed that, compared to the MITC3 shell element, the MITC3+ shell element gives less sensitive solutions to mesh patterns. 5. Conclusions In this paper, the formulation of the MITC3+ shell element was extended to geometric nonlinear analysis. The total Lagrangian formulation is employed allowing for large displacements and large rotations. The nonlinear formulation is based on the same discretization assumptions that are employed in the linear formulation of the element. The nonlinear performance of the MITC3+ shell element was numerically investigated by solving several benchmark problems. In the tests considered, the predictive capability of the MITC3+ shell element is seen to be much better than of the MITC3 shell element. Indeed, the MITC3+ element gave practically as accurate results as the MITC4 shell element. Considering also the excellent behavior of the MITC3+ shell element in linear analysis [1], we can conclude that the element is a very attractive element for general shell analyses. In future studies, it would be valuable to further develop the formulation for large strain solutions of shell structures [30], and to possibly enrich the displacement ﬁelds by using interpolation covers [31].
