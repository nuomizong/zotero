How might 4D printing overcome the obstacles that are hampering the rolling out and scaling up of 3D printing? Skylar Tibbits, Director of the Self-Assembly Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), describes how the Lab has partnered up with Stratasys Ltd, an industry leader in the development of 4D Printing, and is making the development of self-assembly programmable materials and adaptive technologies for industrial application in building design and construction its focus.

Additive manufacturing and rapid prototyping have developed at exceptional rates and gained wide acceptance since their invention in 1984 by Charles Hull. Also the founder of 3D Systems, Charles Hull invented stereolithography as a new process for viewing and testing designs before investing in full production.1 Today, these technologies are used in countless industries, in the home and across the globe. The ability to mass-produce customised components without substantial increases in time, material or inefficiency has been coined as one of the revolutionary advantages of additive manufacturing. However, the realities of our current capabilities are far behind our expectations and visions for additive manufacturing technologies. Further, masscustomisation ignores the time and energy needed after custom parts have been printed, requiring excessive sorting and labour-intensive assembly. Some of the main applications for printing today include food, toys and proof-of-concept prototypes, thus falling far short of our visions for revolutionising manufacturing.2 At the 2013 US Manufacturing Competitiveness Initiative Dialogue on Additive Manufacturing, Boeing’s Michael Hayes highlighted this issue by outlining the main hurdles that lie ahead for additive manufacturing, including: a larger build-envelope and increased scale for printing applications; structural materials that can be used in functional and highperformance settings; and multi-functional and smart/responsive materials.3

Each of these hurdles will need to be addressed and likely combined in order to truly demonstrate the scalability of additive manufacturing to rival existing manufacturing efficiencies. The Self-Assembly Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has as its focus the development of selfassembly, programmable materials and adaptive technologies for industrial applications in the built environment. These phenomena are viewed by the Lab as one of the most important processes in both natural and synthetic systems, and a principle that crosses nearly every discipline, offering a new opportunity for making smarter materials and better techniques for construction. A number of self-assembling, self-reconfiguring and programmable material prototypes have therefore been developed, emphasising the scalability of such principles across materials, fabrication technologies and external energy sources.4 However, many of these prototypes have required an additional production step of embedding ‘programmability’ and the potential energy for transformation; for example, magnets, elastic strands, Nitinol wires, rachetting mechanisms and many others. This challenge, of streamlining the process of production for programmable and adaptive materials, has led to the collaboration with Stratasys Ltd, an industry leader in multi-material printing, and the development of 4D Printing, aimed at offering streamlined multifunctional printed material systems.5

4D Printing 4D Printing is a new process that demonstrates a radical shift in additive manufacturing. It entails multi-material prints with the capability to transform over time, or a customised material system that can change from one shape to another, directly off the print bed. This technique offers a streamlined path from idea to reality with performance-driven functionality built directly into the materials. The fourth dimension is described here as the transformation over time, emphasising that printed structures are no longer simply static, dead objects; rather, they are programmably active and can transform independently. With Connex printing capabilities and 4D Printed materials, a single print, with multi-material features, can transform any one-dimensional strand into a three-dimensional shape, any twodimensional surface into a three-dimensional shape, or morph from one three-dimensional shape into another. Using only water as its activation energy, this demonstrates a new possibility for production and manufacturing. Similarly, adaptive and dynamic responses for structures and products are now plausible without adding time, cost or extra components to make systems ‘smarter’. As environmental, economic, human and other constraints continue to fluctuate, we will continue to require highly resilient systems that can respond with ease and agility. 4D Printing is a first glimpse into the world of evolvable materials that can respond to user needs or environmental changes. At the core of this technology are three key capabilities: the machine, the material and the geometric ‘programme’. Stratasys’s Connex machine offers multi-material PolyJet printing with a variety of material properties from rigid to soft plastics and transparent materials, and high-resolution control over dot deposition. The dynamic material was developed with the Stratasys material research group and is a hydrophilic polymer that expands 150 per cent when it encounters water. The printer deposits a rigid polymer material simultaneously with the expanding ‘active’ material to give both structure and potential energy. The final component important for the viability of 4D Printing is the design and placement of the geometric programme that embeds the capability for statechange directly into the materials themselves.

The rigid material gives the structure and angle limiters for folding. When the part is printed it has an initial position, then after encountering water the active material swells, forcing the rigid material to bend. When the rigid material hits neighbouring elements, it is forced to stop folding and thus has reached the final-state configuration. The placement and volume of the rigid and active materials encompasses an embedded geometric programme and the activation energy to transform from one shape to another, completely independently. MIT and Stratasys have developed a variety of physical prototypes, including strands that fold into the letters ‘MIT’ and complex selffolding Hilbert curves, each demonstrating transformation from one-dimensional and twodimensional flexible shapes into rigid structures.

The first structure was printed as a single strand roughly 30 centimetres (1 foot) in length, containing both rigid and active materials. When dipped in water, the single strand transforms into the letters ‘MIT’, demonstrating a 1D to 2D shapechange. The second experiment also utilised a single strand; however, this 46-centimetre (18-inch) strand, when submerged in water, transformed into a rigid wireframe 3D cube. At each of the joints, two rigid discs were printed that acted as angle limiters, which when folded and touching one another forced the strand to stop at 90-degree angles. Geometrically, this cube is the first generation of a fractal Hilbert curve, where a single line is drawn through all eight points of the cube without overlapping or intersecting. Second- and third-generation Hilbert curves, measuring approximately 4.3 metres (14 feet) and 15 metres (50 feet) in length respectively, were also generated and self-folded, with each folding into a 20-centimetre (8-inch) Hilbert cube. A second series of structures demonstrate surface transformations. In this case, a twodimensional flat plane was printed, with both rigid and active materials. This flat plane represents the six unfolded surfaces of a cube. At each of the joints a long strip of active and rigid materials was printed that describes a 90-degree angle limiter that stops the surface from folding when it reaches the final-state condition. When submerged in water, the surface folds into a closed-surface cube with filleted edges. A wide range of other 1D, 2D and 3D transformations are also possible including self-folding origami, self-healing structures where holes close after encountering water, and other global geometric reconfigurations.

MIT Self-Assembly Lab and Autodesk Research (Skylar Tibbits and Carlos Olguin), Project Cyborg, 2013 Project Cyborg software simulation of a 4D-Printed single strand folding into a three-dimensional cube.

New Physical/Digital Toolsets In order to take advantage of this new transformational technology, from initial idea to physical reality, MIT has collaborated with Autodesk Research in its development of a new software package. Project Cyborg is a design platform spanning applications from the nano scale to the human scale. The software offers simulation for self-assembly and programmable materials as well as optimisation for design constraints and joint folding. The aim is to tightly couple this new cross-disciplinary and crossscalar design tool with the real-world material transformation of 4D Printing. The coupled software and hardware tools will eliminate the traditional paradigms of simulating then building, or building then adjusting the simulation. This workflow aims to create simulations that adjust physical performance and materials that promote new simulated possibilities, offering top-down and bottom-up evolution of design possibilities both physically and digitally. Future Applications The Self-Assembly Lab’s vision for the future of products and processes has radically shifted with the introduction of programmable printed materials. Personal and responsive products will adapt to users’ demands, biometric information, body temperature, sweat and internal pressures. Similarly, products can now become far more resilient and highly tuned to environmental changes including moisture content, temperature, pressure, altitude or sound. Unique and highly tuned products will be manufactured in completely new ways where materials are activated through ambient energies to come together on their own, reconfigure, mutate and replicate. Volume constraints in shipping will be dramatically reduced with flat-pack materials that are activated on delivery to full volume and functionality. Similarly, shipping materials themselves will have non-Newtonian-like properties and respond in custom ways to resist forces and reconfigure space-filling containers for auto-distributed loads. All of these future programmable products will not just be thrown away when they fail; rather, they will error-correct and self-repair to meet new demands. And even when they become obsolete, they can self-disassemble for pure recyclability, breaking themselves down to their fundamental components to be reconstituted as new products with lifelike capabilities in the future.

4D Printing and programmable active materials thus offer exciting opportunities for the future of the products, and the shipping and manufacturing sectors. Transformative, multi-state, additive manufacturing will likely expand to become a palette of many materials with an almost limitless response to external forces. The Self-Assembly Lab aims to develop a full suite of 4D-Printed, fully customisable ‘smart’ materials that respond to various external energies with both single- and dualphase transformations. 1
