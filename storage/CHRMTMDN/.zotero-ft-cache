Finite element analysis of stiffened plates

Received 2008-01-18

Abstract The paper presents the development of a new plate/shell stiﬀener element and the subsequent application in determine frequencies, mode shapes and buckling loads of diﬀerent stiﬀened panels. In structural modelling, the plate and the stiﬀener are treated as separate ﬁnite elements where the displacement compatibility transformation takes into account the torsion – ﬂexural coupling in the stiﬀener and the eccentricity of internal (contact) forces between the beam – plate/shell parts. The model becomes considerably more ﬂexible due to this coupling technique. The development of the stiﬀener is based on a general beam theory, which includes the constraint torsional warping eﬀect and the second order terms of ﬁnite rotations. Numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the importance of torsion warping constraints. As part of the validation of the results, complete shell ﬁnite element analyses were made for stiﬀened plates.

Many engineering structures consist of stiﬀened thin plate and shell elements to improve the strength/weight ratio. The buckling and vibration characteristics of stiﬀened plates and shells subjected to initial or dead loads are of considerable importance to mechanical and structural engineers. Among the known solution techniques, the ﬁnite element method is certainly the most favourable. Using the technique where stiﬀeners are modelled by beam ﬁnite elements, Jirousek [1] formulated a 4-node isoparametric beam element including transverse shear and Saint-Venant torsion eﬀects. More recent studies on dynamic and buckling problems of stiﬀened plates and shells are available in [2]-[5]. It is a common feature of these ﬁnite element based methods that in order to attain displacement continuity, a rigid ﬁctitious link is applied to connect one node in the plate element to the beam node shearing the same section. This approach neglects the out-of-plane warping displacements of the beam section and, in such cases, the usual formulation overestimates the stiﬀener torsional rigidity. To eliminate this problem Patel et al. in [5] introduced a torsion correction factor. This is analogous to the shear correction factor commonly introduced in the shear deformation beam theory. The main objects of the present paper is to propose an eﬃcient procedure modelling the connection between the plate/shell and the stiﬀener, and as part of it the constraint torsion eﬀect in the stiﬀener. According to Saint-Venant’s theory of free torsion, the cross-section does not generally remain plain and the points can move freely in the direction of the beam axis and the angle of torsion changes linearly with a constant rate. If this torsional warping is restricted by external or internal constraints, then the rate of torsion will also change along the beam axis. The theory of constraint torsion was developed by Vlasov [6]. Apart from [7], the author could not ﬁnd any work in the literature involved in the examination of constrained torsion in the stiﬀener of complex plate/shell structures. However, the eﬀect is obvious, especially in terms of dynamic and stability phenomena when the global characteristics of a structure are investigated, such as frequencies, mode shapes, or critical loads causing a loss of stability. Investigations of stand-alone beam structures proved that

an approximate or more accurate modelling of the torsional stiﬀness, eccentricity, or mass distribution can considerably modify the results. Theoretically – and practically as well, if there is adequate capacity available – beam-type components in complex structures can also be modelled by ﬂat shell, or even spatial ﬁnite elements. Consequently, the size of the model and the number of degrees of freedom will change considerably, increasing the time required for calculations and making the interpretation and evaluation of results more diﬃcult. It is a better solution if the properties of components are improved and the ranges of phenomena possible to be modelled are increased at the element level. As the objective of this paper is to study the eﬀect of constraint torsion and the coupling methods, the shear deformation of the beam is neglected and the formulation of the stiﬀener is based on the well-known Bernoulli – Vlasov theory. For the ﬁnite element analysis, cubic Hermitian polynomials are utilized as the beam shape functions of lateral and torsional displacements. The stiﬀener element has two nodes with seven degrees of freedom per node. In order to maintain displacement compatibility between the beam and the stiﬀened element, a special transformation is used, which includes the coupling of torsional and bending rotations and the eccentricity of internal forces between the stiﬀener and the plate elements.

In this work, the basic assumptions are as follows: the beam member is straight and prismatic, the cross-section is not deformed in its own plane but is subjected to torsional warping, rotations are large but strains are small, the material is homogeneous, isotropic and linearly elastic. Let us have a straight, prismatic beam member with an arbitrary cross-section as it is shown in Fig. 1. The local x axis of the right-handed orthogonal system is parallel to the axis of the beam and passes through the end nodes N1 and N2 . The coordinate axes y and z are parallel to the principal axes, marked as r and s. The positions of the centroid C and shear centre S in the plane of each section are given by the relative co-ordinates y N C , z N C and yC S , zC S . The external loads are applied along points P located y S P and z S P from the shear centre.

Displacement parameters are deﬁned at the shear centre S as shown in Fig. 2. Accordingly, u, v, and w are the rigid body translations in the x, y and z directions of point S and α, β and γ denote rigid body rotations about the shear centre axes parallel to x, y and z, respectively. The small out-of-plane torsional R warping displacement is deﬁned by the ϑ(x) warping parameter r and the φ(r,s) warping function normalized with respect to the shear centre. The φ satisﬁes the following conditions: . φd A = 0,

It should be noticed that energy functional (6) was consistently obtained corresponding to semitangential internal moments because the term (8) due to initial bending and torsion moments was derived based on inclusion of second order terms of semitangential rotations in Eq.

Coupling of the structural components and composition of the system matrices referring to the entire structure are based on the fact that the parameters (degrees of freedom) of connecting nodes are identical. This condition, if it was formulated with the required accuracy, ensures the displacement continuity along connecting surfaces (lines, points).

elements, the beam nodes are forced to undergo the displacements and rotations prescribed by the corresponding plate/shell nodes. In this case the stiﬀener element follows an edge of the shell/plate element and the constraint condition is introduced by considering a rigid ﬁctious link between the beam section and the plate/shell node N on the common normal. In such a model, on the basis of U displacement vector in Eq. (2), the displacements and rotations of a nodal point N, with the co-ordinates r = -y N C and s = -z N C (see Fig. 1) in the plane of the cross-section, will be as follows: u x = u − βy N C + γ z N C ,u y = v + α (z N C + z C S ) , ¯ u z = w − α (y N C + yC S ) ,

This transformation takes the eccentricity into account but obviously neglects the eﬀect of torsional warping.
3.1 Continuity of rotations

If a beam is connected to another component not only in its cross-section but along a narrow stripe on its surface, the transformation (20) is not suﬃcient to assure the required displacement continuity. During torsion, while the cross-section turns around point S by an angle α, the originally straight connecting line crossing points N assumes a spiral shape. The rotation arising there is proportional with the distance between points S and N. Using the notations of Fig. 3, the vector of spiral rotation can be described as   0 dα   = − R S N = ϑ (R N C + RC S ) = ϑ  y N C + yC S  . dx z N C + zC S (21) Supplementing rotations in Eq. (19) by this:
x

Accordingly, as regards transformations, a deﬁnite diﬀerence should be made between beam-to-beam coupling in beam structures when Eq. (20) can be applied, and stiﬀener element coupling, when Eq. (22) is suitable. In this form, the latter can be used for any other beam ﬁnite elements regardless of the number of element nodes, or the beam theory applied.
3.2 Eccentricity of internal forces

The calculation of kGe load stiﬀness matrix of the stiﬀener element requires some remarks. The stiﬀener load is not known directly as the proportion of the total external (initial) load on the stiﬀening element depends on relative stiﬀness conditions. Nevertheless, initial internal forces or contact forces between the stiﬀener and the plating along the contact line can be calculated from the equilibrium condition of initial state. Hereinafter the contact point should be the node N and using the notation as indicated in Fig. 1, the load eccentricities, if N = P are: z S P = z S N = − (z N C + z C S ) , (23) There is a simple way to calculate the stiﬀener load stiﬀness, if the cubic elements are used to deﬁne the initial stress state. It follows from the shape functions (15) that the N normal and Vr , Vs shear forces (see Fig. 3) are constant along a straight beam element, but diﬀerent from element to element, and the bending and torsional moments are linearly varying. This internal force y S P = y S N = − (y N C + yC S ) ,

distribution can be replaced by external forces acting at the two end nodes of an element: Fx1 = −N , Fx2 = +N , Fy1 = −Vr , Fy2 = +Vr , Fz1 = −Vs , (24) Fz2 = +Vs .

With these end loads and (23) eccentricities in Eq. (18), the additive stiﬀness due to oﬀ axis contact loads acting along the joint line is expressed as from which the kGe matrix, likewise Eq. (18) with P = N, can be derived in a simple way:

were implemented in the VEM7 ﬁnite element system. The fournoded thick shell element was derived by combining a quadrilateral Mindlin plate element of Bathe and Dvorkin [14] (known as MITC4, mixed interpolation of tensorial components) with a plane-stress element where the contribution of drilling degrees of freedom was taken into account as it was proposed by Allman and Cook [15].

Here it is worth to note that the contact forces are part of the internal force system and the internal moments – as it was proved in [8] – are of semitangential nature. For this reason the moment terms are missing in Eq. (25).
4 Numerical analysis and discussions

With the assembled system matrices the equation of motion of the structure without mechanical load increments can be written as Ü + [K L + λ (KG + KGe )] U = 0 This is the general equation and it can be reduced as a special case to get the governing equation for free vibration and buckling problems as follows: K L − ω2 M U = 0, [K L + λ (KG + KGe )] U = 0,

A rectangular stiﬀened panel on Fig. 4 consists of a ﬂat plate with equally spaced longitudinal thin walled T-stiﬀeners that span between girders. Fig. 5 shows a section of the stiﬀened plate considered in this investigation. Because of the symmetry in the structure, only a portion of the plate of width b (b = 600 mm) with a T-stiﬀener centred on the plate strip, was modelled. In the ﬁnite element models the rotation about the longitudinal axis (the X axis in Fig. 4) and the lateral displacement were suppressed at all the nodes along the longitudinal edges to simulate the panel continuity (symmetry boundary conditions, x rotation and u y displacement are zero) and the X = 0 and X = L ends of the panel are ﬁxed. The material properties are: E = 2, 0105 MPa, ν = 0,3 and the mass density: ρ = 8,0 10−9 N sec2 /mm4 . In order to model the wider range of behaviour of the panel, the plate dimensions and the beam section shape unchanged (b = 600 mm, t = 4 mm), the area of stiﬀener was scaled in proportion to the web thickness. Using the usual thin walled approximations, the cross sectional properties for the T-beam as the function of tw are: t f = tw , b f = 10t f , bw = 2b f , 2 4 4 A = 30tw , Ir = 1402, 5tw , Is = 85tw , 4 , I = 0, β = 16t , J = 10tw ω r w z N C = − (13, 5tw + 2) , z C S = −7tw ,

(26)

where ω is the natural frequency and λ is the critical load parameter. The goal of the following numerical study is to compare the adequacy of two stiﬀener coupling transformations detailed in Section 3. First is the usual “rigid lever arm” coupling according to Eq. (20), and the other is the proposed stiﬀener coupling transformation including the internal force eccentricity in accordance to Eqs. (22) and (25). In the following these will be called of BM (beam) and ST (stiﬀener) coupling, respectively. These transformations, together with the 7 degrees of freedom per node beam element and a four-noded thick shell element,

and the non-dimensional plate to beam area ratio parameter is given by b f t f + bw tw As t2 δ= = = w . (27) Ap bt 80 In order to verify the BM and ST results of present study a COSMOS/M shell model was employed. In that model the plate and the thin walled beam was composed of the same four node shell4t thick shell element with six degrees of freedom per node.

with smaller frequencies. It is observed from the Tables 1.a,b that in case of δ = 0,2 the rate of decrease is around 17%.

The mode shapes of the stiﬀened panel for the ﬁrst three modes are shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 presents the variation of the ﬁrst three frequencies in terms of δ size parameter. As it can be seen the frequency of the b1 bending mode is the same in both BM and ST cases for all δ value. In contrast with bending modes, there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the values of BM-t1, ST-t1 and BM-t2, ST-t2 torsional frequencies. The curves on Fig. 7 show that the diﬀerence is zero if δ = 0 (no stiﬀener) and tends to zero with increasing stiﬀener size and rigidity. In these extreme cases the plate or the stiﬀener rigidity controls the structure, thus the coupling method is of less importance. It can be stated generally, that ST coupling results in a less rigid model

where an excellent agreement has been found for the frequencies between the ST and shell results.
4.3 Buckling analysis

To investigate the eﬀect of BM and ST coupling methods on the buckling loads and modes, the elastic buckling of the panel subjected to longitudinal compression is studied in this section. This kind of uniaxial compression can be produced by an Ux0 axial displacement of the X= L end of the panel. Here, Ux0 = 1 mm compression corresponds to σx0,beam = −Ux0 σx0, plate E = −111, 1M Pa, L E = −Ux0 = −122, 1M Pa, 1 − ν2 L

plate/shell coupling method. It was shown that in all torsion related cases the proposed ST method leads to a less rigid model. The results show good agreement with complete shell solutions. This fact indicates that the application range can be extended. Though further work can be undertaken to perform dynamic and buckling analysis of really curved panels with stiﬀeners, the newly developed coupling method can be useful for future investigators.

normal stress in the beam and plate, respectively. The buckling mode shapes of the stiﬀened panel for diﬀerent stiﬀener sections are shown in Fig. 8a-b. Fig. 9 shows the change of buckling modes and λ critical load parameter in terms of δ size parameter. If the stiﬀener section is small the buckling mode is the overall (sometimes called Euler buckling) ﬂexural mode and the result is independent of the coupling method. For higher stiﬀener sections torsional buckling mode, called of tripping will occur prior to ﬂexural buckling. In contrast with ﬂexural mode, there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the buckling loads of BM-t1 and ST-t1 coupling method, and just as in the dynamic analysis, the ST coupling results in a less rigid model with smaller critical loads. It is observed from the Table 2 that in case of δ = 0,2 the rate of decrease is around 30%. As the stiﬀener tripping is a coupled lateral torsional-bending motion, the accurate modelling of torsional properties are of great importance. A detailed analysis of the diﬀerent buckling modes of stiﬀened panels, including the parametric analysis of tripping, can be found in recent papers of Yuren et al. [16], Sheikh et al. [17] and Hughes et al. [18].

With increasing stiﬀener size and rigidity the diﬀerence between BM and ST results vanish. The uniform asymptotic critical load in Fig. 9 indicates the buckling of plate between the stiﬀeners, as it is shown in Fig. 8. On Fig. 9 quite satisfactory agreement can be seen for the critical load parameter between the ST and shell results marked with black dots.
5 Conclusions

In this study a detailed numerical evaluation has been performed to prove the eﬃciency of the proposed stiﬀener –
