Abstract
Analysis of composite sti ened panels used in aerospace, ship and other engineering structures by the method of ÿnite elements has been presented. The formulation presented is based on the concept of equal displacements at the shell–sti ener interface. An eight-noded isoparametric shell element is used in association with three-noded curved beam element for the formulation of the sti ened panel element. First-order shear deformation theory is used in the present study. The sti ness matrix of the sti ener is computed ÿrst irrespective of its position within the plate/shell element. The sti ness matrix so computed for the sti ener is then transferred to that of the plate/shell element nodes depending on its position and orientation within the element before assembling the element sti ness matrix. A generalised formulation for the hat-shaped sti ener is presented. The investigation is restricted to linear static analysis of composite sti ened panels and parametric studies have been made to study the various aspects of laminated composite shell with open and closed shaped sti eners. ? 2002 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction
Sti ened shell structures are extensively used in aircraft structures, ship and boat hulls, bridge decks and other industrial applications. Further, the use of advanced composite materials has increased in the above engineering applications because of their outstanding strength, sti ness and lightweight properties and ease of construction with complex shapes. The purpose of the present study is to present a ÿnite element formulation for the linear static analysis of laminated sti ened shell panels, which are considered to be the building blocks of di erent engineering structures.

past, various approaches of modelling composite sti ened panels by method of ÿnite elements have taken new dimension. Satisfying the displacement compatibility at plate/shell and sti ener interface simpliÿes the complexity of the problem to a greater extent.
Literatures available on isotropic and laminated sti ened plate analysis are plenty. Review of work on static and dynamic analysis of isotropic sti ened shells has been reported by Sinha and Mukhopadhyay [1]. Various researchers [2–8] have reported research works on static analysis of laminated curved panels. Gunay [9] presented geometrically non-linear ÿnite element analysis of laminated sti ened cylindrical shallow shells using composite shallow shell with stringer-type sti eners. In his analysis, two side meshing system is generated to represent cylindrical shell with sti eners in a three-dimensional co-ordinate system. No discussion has been made for the sti eners of various shapes and having arbitrary orientation in the plate/shell panel. Barut [10] developed a sti ened shell element by combining shallow shell for the skin and beam element for the sti ener. The formulation of the sti ened element was achieved by constraining the displacement and rotation ÿelds of the beam element. A geometric non-linear analysis of composite laminate has been formulated. Though the study mentions about the incorporation of arbitrary shape and arbitrarily oriented sti eners, only one example on laminated cross-ply sti ened shell with rectangular sti ener has been covered.
A ÿnite element formulation has been presented here for the linear static analysis of laminated composite sti ened plates and shells with sti eners of various shapes, i.e. open and closed section under transverse loading and various boundary conditions. The element used here is an eight-noded

1127

quadratic isoparametric for the shell and three-noded beam element for the sti ener. The ÿrst-order shear deformation theory is adopted. Discussion of the theory has not been given emphasis, which is beyond the scope of the present limited study. The analysis takes care of thin/thick and shallow/deep shells elegantly. The concept of equal displacement at the shell–sti ener junction is taken care in this formulation. The formulation for sti ened panel presented here takes care of arbitrarily oriented sti eners placed anywhere inside the element and a generalised formulation for open and closed section sti ener is presented. This approach overcomes the complication imposed by the earlier ones by replacing the sti eners with a plate/shell of orthotropic properties or by aligning the nodal lines along the sti eners. The new approach of analysing isotropic sti ened shells with rectangular sti eners only has been implemented for the static analysis under transverse loading by Prusty and Satsangi [11]. In the present work, the formulation has been modiÿed to incorporate laminated composite materials for the shell and generalised formulation for the open and closed section laminated sti eners has been presented.

2. Finite element formulation

2.1. Sti ness matrix of the shell element

Based on the assumptions of Mindlin’s hypothesis, a C0 continuity large curvature shell element

having eight nodes with ÿve degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) (u; v; w; Âs and Âr) is used in the present investigation. On a shell surface ‘S’, two orthogonal curvilinear co-ordinates having radius

of curvatures R1 and R2 in the s and r axis, respectively (Fig. 1), are deÿned for the global co-ordinate values of x, y and z. The strain terms considered for a doubly curved laminated shell

by Chandrashekhara [12] are expressed as

2.2. Sti ness matrix of sti ener element

The sti ener has been modelled as a three-noded curved beam element having ÿve d.o.f. per node as in the case of shell element nodes (Fig. 1). The skew beam formulation of Martini and Vitaliani [13] has been implemented in this formulation. The derivation of sti ness matrix of sti ener element has been made based on the following generalised strain components taken into consideration:

Due to the curvature and eccentricity of the sti ener, the displacements at the middle surface of the sti ener are transformed to the middle surface of the shell using a suitable transformation. The detailed derivation of such case for a shell structure with rectangular sti eners within the shell element is explained in [11]. In the derivation of sti ness matrix for arbitrarily oriented sti ener, the strain–displacement matrix considered is

{ stf } = [Bstf ]i{ stf }i:

Consideration for the curvature of sti ener has been taken care in the strain–displacement relationship matrix [Bstf ]. The nodal displacements of the sti ener element { stf } are transformed to the shell element nodes by using the transformation matrix as

The stress–strain relationship matrix for the sti ener element is expressed as

{ stf } = [Dstf ]{ stf };

(9)

where [Dstf ] is the rigidity matrix of the sti ener. The rigidity matrix for the laminated sti ener having open and closed sections has been explained separately in the subsequent section.
The sti ness matrix of the sti ener element is then evaluated considering the strain energy of the sti ener element as

[Kstf ] = [T ]T[ ]T[K stf ][T ][ ];

[K stf ] = [Bstf ]T[Dstf ][Bstf ] ds:

Two-point Gauss integration method is adopted in the derivation of the sti ness matrix.

2.3. Rigidity matrix of the hat sti ener
The rigidity matrix of the hat sti ener has been developed as a sum of three segments of the sti ener (Fig. 2) for the analysis. The present formulation for the closed section (hat) sti ener has the capability to model the open section sti eners such as I, T and rectangular-shaped sti eners using the same rigidity matrix by suitable changes in the input for the sti ener geometry.

The above properties are transformed to the plate mid-plane using parallel axes theorem. The torsional rigidity (Jh) of the closed section (Fig. 3) is calculated on the basis of elliptical section formula [14].

For rectangular section the shear correction factor is considered as 5/6 to take care of the parabolic variation of the transverse shear strain.

3. Validation and parametric study
3.1. Centrally sti ened laminated shell
In the ÿrst part of the investigation, the static analysis of an all edges clamped laminated shell sti ened with a laminated ‘hat’-shaped sti ener is considered. The sti ened shell structures (Fig. 4) having curvature ratio (R=a) = 5 is subjected to uniformly distributed transverse loading on the shell. In this investigation, the loading considered on the structure is uniformly distributed for all the cases. The geometry, the material properties and the loading on the centrally sti ened and cross-sti ened cylindrical shell shown in Fig. 4 is considered as Span (a) = 1000 mm, E1 = 175:78 × 103 N=mm2, E2 = 7:031 × 103 N=mm2, G12 = 3:516 × 103 N=mm2, G23 = 1:406 × 103 N=mm2 and = 0:25.
In order to check the accuracy of the present formulation, analysis has been carried out using the present formulation and also using the general-purpose commercial software package NISA (Numerical Integrated Elements for System Analysis) ( NISA Manual [16]). An eight-noded solid element (NKTP = 7 and NORDER = 1) with three degrees of freedom per node has been used to model the structure using the NISA software. An 8 × 8 mesh for the full shell is considered in the analysis using the commercial software NISA. The modelling of the sti ened structure using NISA involved 160 elements whereas the present formulation used only 64 elements.

3.2. Cross-sti ened laminated shell
A cross-sti ened laminated shell structure (Fig. 4(b)) is considered for validation of the present formulation. Two- and four-layered antisymmetric lamination sequences in the shell and the sti eners have been considered. The structure is subjected to a uniformly distributed load as in the previous case. As in the previous case, the analysis is carried out using a 8 × 8 mesh size for the full shell using NISA and the present formulation. A close agreement is observed between the results using the present formulation and the NISA solution in both the cases. Figs. 7 and 8 show the comparison of displacements at the quarter point along the r-axis of a cross-sti ened cylindrical shell.
3.3. Parametric study
In the next part of investigation, a parametric study has been carried out for a centrally sti ened laminated cylindrical shell (Fig. 4(a)). The sti ener sections considered are closed (‘hat’ shaped) and open (rectangular and ‘T’ shaped) keeping the cross-sectional area same for all the types of sti eners, Fig. 9.
The parametric study on centrally sti ened laminated cylindrical shells covers the following aspects:
1. E ect of R=a ratio. 2. E ect of thickness ratio and R=a ratio.
Tables 1 and 2 show the comparison of displacement values at the quarter point (point A shown in Fig. 4(a)) of the clamped, laminated sti ened cylindrical shell. Antisymmetric cross- and angle-ply lamination sequences with two and four layers are considered.

(a) In the case of a plate (R=a = 1e30), a signiÿcant reduction in displacement is observed due to a hat-sti ener as compared to sti eners of other sections, i.e. T and rectangular. However, the di erence diminishes as the R=a values decreases and the structure tends towards a deep sti ened shell.

(b) With the increase in ply angle for the symmetric and antisymmetric lamination, the sti ened cylindrical shell has a greater sti ness.
(c) For the same laminate thickness, the displacement decreases with the increase in the number of layers in the laminate.
(d) For all values of R=a, the sti ened shell with a hat-sti ener shows a smaller displacement at the point under consideration than a shell with sti eners of ‘T’ and rectangular sections of equal cross-sectional area.

Table 3 shows a comparison of the displacements of shells of varying thickness and curvature. The lamination sequence in the shell and the sti ener are taken as [0=90=0=90]T. The displacements at the quarter point (point A shown in Fig. 4(a)) of the clamped sti ened cylindrical shell with hat/T/rectangular sti ener are analysed. From the values in Table 3, the following observations may be made:
(a) With a smaller thickness ratio (a=h), i.e. a thick shell, the e ect of the sti ener is insigniÿcant, so that the maximum displacement occurs at the centre of cylindrical shell. However for comparison purposes, the quarter point displacement is considered. Then, for a thin shell, i.e. with a higher a=h ratio, the displacement values are signiÿcantly high.
(b) With an increase in the curvature ratio (R=a), i.e. as the shell becomes shallower, the displacement increases substantially.
(c) A laminated sti ened shell with a ‘hat’-shaped sti ener shows less displacement as compared to a shell with a ‘T’ or rectangular sti ener of equal cross-sectional area in almost all the cases presented.
4. Conclusions
Finite element static analysis of composite sti ened plate/shell panels using eight-noded isoparametric element for shell and three-noded curved beam element for sti ener is presented. Modiÿed approach for the shell and sti ener is adopted and concept of equal displacement at shell–sti ener junction is utilised. Uniÿed formulation for laminated arbitrarily oriented hat sti ener is presented. The present method obviates the limitations of positioning the sti ener along nodal lines, which is a substantial improvement over the existing methods. Comparison of results for few examples on static analysis of laminated sti ened plate/shell panels from the published work validates the present formulation and the parametric study gives an overview regarding the selection of sti ener sections in engineering designs.
