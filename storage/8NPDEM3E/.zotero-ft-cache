Abstract-A displacement-based versatile and elktive finite clement is presented for linear and geometric and material nonlinear analysis of plates and shells. The element is formulated by interpolating the element geometry using the mid-surface nodal point coordinates and mid-surface nodal point normals. A total and an updated Lagrangian formulation are presented, that allow very large displacements and rotations. In linear analysis of plates, the element reduore to well-established plate bending elements based on classical plate theory, whereas in liir analysis of shells and geometrically nonlii analysis of plates and shells by use of the clement in essence+a very general shell theory is employed. The element has been implemented as a variable-number-nodes element and can also be employed as a fully compatible transition element to model shell intersections and shell-solid regions. In the paper various sample solutions are presented that illustrate the effectiveness of the element in practical analysis.

1. INTRODUCl’lON

analysis of plate and shell structures is of considerable interest in various areas of structural mechanics, It is, therefon, natural that with the development of the finite element method a large

The

number of different finite elements have been formulated for the analysis of plate and shell problems. In these developments, basically two approaches have been followed: firstly, what may be called a classical procedure and, secondly, an approach in which displacement/rotation isoparametric elements are employed. In the first approach a classical concept is employed, in which a plate or shell theory is used as the starting point of the finite element formulation. This plate or shell theory has been developed from the threedimensional field equations by incorporating various assumptions appropriate to the structural behavior. Using variational formulations based on these theories various finite element models have been developed; namely, displacement, hybrid, and mixed formulations [l-5]. In the second approach, isoparametric elements with independent rotational and displacement degrees of freedom are employed. This procedure was originally introduced by Ahmad et al. [6] for the linear analysis of moderately thick and thin shells, and has recently been applied also to the nonlinear analysis of shells by Ramm [7] and Krakeland [8]. The basic ideas for the development of the displacement/rotation isoparametricelements evolved from the difhculties that are encountered when using the usual displacement isoparametric elements in the analysis of plates and shells. Firstly, computational difficulties can result when these isoparametric elements are very thin, because the stiffness coefficients corresponding to the transverse displacement degrees
23

of freedom are considerably larger than those corresponding to the longitudinal displacements. Secondly, errors are introduced in the analysis because erroneous strain energy corresponding to the normal stresses in the thickness direction is included These two difIiculties are overcome in the approach introduced by Ahmad et al, because it is assumed that the normal to the shell surface remains straight and does not extend, and the normal stresses in the direction of the shell thickness are ignored in the element formulation. The conceptual advantage of the displacement/rotation isoparametric elements is their inherent generality, which is analogous to the generality of the isoparametric elements in the analysis of two- and three-dimensional continuum problems. In contrast to the classical approach, no specific classical plate or shell theory is employed; instead, the geometry and the displacement field of the structure are directly discretixed and interpolated as in the analysis of continuum problems. This approach is equivalent to using a general shell theory and can be employed efficiently for the analysis of general structural configurations by using variable-number-nodes elements [9, lo]. The objective in this paper is to present the formulation, implementation and application of a general variable-number-nodes rotation/displacement isoparametric element for linear and geometric and material nonlinear analysis of plates and shells. This element has been developed to be employed in much the same way as the variable-number-nodes isoparametric continuum elements and can directly be connected to these elements. The underlying philosophy of the development was that it is user-effective to be able to analyze various types of structures with what is basically a single element that is effective in linear

The basic aim of the analysis is to establish an equation of virtual work from which the unknown static and kinematic variables in the configuration at time t + At can be solved. Since the displacement-based finite element procedure shall be employed for numerical solution, we use the principle of virtual displacements to express the equilibrium of the body. In order to solve for the static and kinematic variables of the body at time t + At, in essence, two different formulations can be. employed [14]. In the total Lagrangian (T.L.) formulation all static and kinematic variables are referred to the initial configuration at time 0. The updated Lagrangian (U. L.) formulation is based on the same procedures that are used in the T. L. formulation, but in the solution all static and kinematic variables are referred to the last calculated configuration at time t. Various applications of both formulations in the analysis of continuum problems are presented in [14,15], where it was shown, in particular, that both the T. L. and U. L. formulations include all nonlinear effects due to large displacements, large strains and material nonlinearities. The only advantage of using one formulation rather than the other is that it may yield a more effective numerical solution. In the following sections, we develop the governing equations for the geometric and material nonlinear analysis of shell structures. In the discussion, we develop first the matrix expressions that describe the nonlinear kinematic behavior of the shell element, and we discuss afterwards briefly the use of appropriate constitutive relations.

analysis and geometric and material nonlinear analysis [ll, 121. The concepts of the formulation of the shell element are those used earlier by Ahmad et al. for linear elastic analysis, and Ramm and Krakeland for nonlinear analysis [6-81. However, the actual effective usage of those concepts depends on the details of the formulation and implementation, and the element presented in this paper is in a number of important aspects, that are discussed in the paper, more general and more effective than the shell elements oublished earlier. These aspects include the choice of effective rotational decrees of freedom: the use of quadrilateral or triangular, low or high-order elements for geometric and/or materially nonlinear analysis; the use of a special transition element to model structural intersections, and the use of the element in the analysis of stiffened plates and shells. In the paper, we first present the large displacement formulation of the variable-number-nodes element. Starting from the basic continuum mechanics virtual work theorem an updated Lagrangian (U.L.) and a total Lagrangian (T. L.) formulation are presented, that allow very large displacements and rotations, and materially nonlinear conditions. Considering linear analysis we point out that the simplest elements (the three-node triangular and four node-quadrilateral plate elements) of the variable-number-nodes element are the elements considered by Hughes et al. using the Mindlin plate theory [13]. Next we describe some important aspects pertaining to the formulation, implementation and usage of the element. In the practical analysis of shell structures it is important that a shell element can be employed to model arbitrary and complex geometries with variable shell thickness, cut-outs, discrete reinforcing and eccentric stiffeners and branches and intersections. In the paper we show how the element can be employed to model such analysis complexities using special transition elements and compatible threedimensional bending elements. Also, it is pointed out that using higher-order shell elements no reduced integration need be employed. Finally, we present in the paper the results of a number of sample analyses that demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of the element. First, solutions are presented to’ some simple problems merely to demonstrate some important features of the element : its high accuracy without reduced integration and its use in the analysis of stiffened shells and shell intersections are illustrated, and the results of a convergence study using various nodal point configurations are given. In this convergence study the shell element was used as a parabolic and cubic, quadrilateral and triangular element. Next, the solution results of some highly nonlinear problems are given and discussed, and based on the experiences with the element it is concluded that the shell element presented in this paper is highly effective and versatile for the practical analysis of general shell structures.

prior to the incremental analysis. Thus, all shell elements meeting at the nodal point k of a shell surface have the same vector as mid-surface normal as illustrated in Fig. 3. When defkring the normal at a nodal point it may be that the assumption of a single normal is inappropriate at the intersection of shell surfaces. These intersections can be modeled using a different nodal point (with the same coordinates) corresponding to each shell surface and constraint equations to couple the nodal degrees of freedom [ll 1, or, more effectively, using transition elements (see Section 3.4). To express the components Vi, in terms of rotation angles, we first define two unit vectors ‘V: and 5’: that are orthogonal to ‘V” (see Fig. 4),

2.3 Constitutive

In the previous sections we assumed that appropriate constitutive relations are used (see Tables 1 and 3), as was already discussed for continuum elements in [14,15]. Consider first a linear elastic material. In this case the usual Young’s moduli and Poisson ratios are employed to define the constitutive tensor, which in the U. L. formulation relates Cauchy stresses and Ahnansi strains, and in the T.L. formulation relates 2nd Piola-Kirchhoff stresses to Green-Lagrange strains. In analyses with large rotations but small strains (as in most shell problems) negligible differences can then be observed between the response predictions using the U. L. and T. L. formulations.

Considering elastioplastic analysis, as pointed out earlier [14], it is effective to employ the T. L. formulation for large rotation but small strain analysis, because the convected Cauchy stresses and small strain increments are numerically equal to the 2nd Piola-Kirchhoff stresses and Green-Lagrange strain increments, respectively. Hence, the stresses and strains in the T. L. formulation can directly be employed as usual to establish the elastioplastic constitutive relations. We should note that in the formulations given all six stress and strain components in the Cartesian coordinate directions .are calculated, and the constitutive tensor corresponding to these components is

used in Tables 1 and 3. To obtain this tensor with the shell assumption that the stress normal to the shell is zero, we use the usual three-dimensional constitutive relations corresponding to the r, s and t directions, impose the condition that the normal stress is zero and then transform the modified constitutive relations to correspond to the Cartesian coordinate axes. Here, it should be noted that if the element is employed to model a plate which is flat initially, but not necessarily aligned with the global coordinate system, in geometrically linear analysis and when using the T. L. formulation only one transformation matrix to calculate the constitutive matrix need be established for each element.

SOME IMPORTANT

FEATURES

OF THE ELEMENT

The variabk-number-nodes shell element is a very versatile element. In this section we summarize some of its pertinent theoretical and practical features. 3.1 Interpolation functions As shown in Fig. 1, the ekment can have a minimum of three nodes and a maximum of sixteen nodes, in which case the functions h,(r,s) are the usual Lagrangian cubic interpolation functions. The interpolation functions of an N-node element are basically constructed using the procedure in [9,p. 1301, and more specific details are given in [lo].

3.2 Comparison of element with elements
bused on plate theory

In the previous section, we presented the formulation of a general shell element for large displacement and rotation analysis. Both, the U. L. and the T. L. formulations reduce as usual to a linear analysis in the first step of the incremental solution. In the linear analysis of plates, the element is identical to those discussed by Ahmad et al. [6], Zienkiewin [2], and Hughes et al. [13]. Ahmad, Irons and Zienkiewicz used the formulation employed in this paper, whereas Hughes et al. employed the Mindlin plate theory that includes shear deformations to obtain the stiffness matrix of the four-node quadrilateral element and then studied element improvements by selective integration. The important point is that in linear analysis of plates, therefore, the shell element is based on classical plate theory including shear deformations and all element matrices can also be derived using this theory. Considering large displacement analysis, the basic assumptions of the linear plate theory are still employed, but the element matrices are calculated using general nonlinear continuum mechanics equations with no assumptions on the magnitude of the plate displacements and rotations. This approach is equivalent to using a general nonlinear shell theory. 3.3 Numerical integration To evaluate the element matrices, it is necessary, in general, to employ numerical integration. In this study, we employed for the quadrilateral elements the usual Gauss integration used in isoparametric finite element analysis, and for the triangular elements the integration formulas proposed by Cowper [ 16 3, the order of integration being dependent on the order of interpolation employed 19.~. 1651 and whether elastic or elastic-plastic material conditions are modeled. It should be noted that with the higher-order elementsno reduced integration is necessary to obtain accurate solutions (see Section 4.1). This obs&vation is important; namely, in general shell analysis reduced integration in the evaluation of an element stiffness matrix must be employed with care and, in practice, is still best avoided. Using reduced or selective integration the difficulties are that, for all possible geometric shapes, the finite element must not contain small spurious eigenvalues (or develop such eigenvalues in the incremental solution), and the element must satisfy all convergence requirements and display good accuracy characteristics. The precise effect of using reduced integration in general large displacement analysis is very difficult to assess and has not yet been established. Furthermore, considering materially nonlinear analysis, a higher-order integration may be desirable anyway, in order to capture the variation in the constitutive relations. 3.4 Use of top and bottom displacement nodes In the analysis of an actual shell structure, it may be necessary to model shell intersections and shell to solid transitions. These geometric regions can be modeled effectively without the use of constraint equations using transition elements, which have mid-surface nodes to couple into other shell elements and top and

bottom nodes to connect to each other or to the usual three-dimensional isoparametric elements (see Fig. 5). The interpolation functions corresponding to the top and bottom nodes are the usual functions used in three-dimensional analysis, and the interpolation functions associated with the mid-surface nodes are those of the shell element. 3.5 Element description To describe an assemblage of variable-numbernodes shell elements the following input is required: (i) the shell nodal point coordinates; (ii) the shell mid-surface normals, “Vi, at all midsurface nodes; (iii) the shell thickness, a,, at all mid-surface nodes; one thickness is defined at each mid-surface node; (iv) the material properties of the elements. 3.6 Formulation of a compatible bending element The procedure of the shell element formulation presented in Section 2 can also be employed to formulate a three-dimensional bending element. Assuming a rectangular solid cross-section as shown in Fig. 6, we use in the formulation instead of eqn (2)

‘Vi, = component i of unit normal vector, ‘Vt, in sdirection, and N is the number of nodes of the element, N = 2, 3 or 4. Using eqn (20) in the same way as eqn (2) for the shell element, the bending element matrices corresponding to the six degrees of freedom per node shown in Fig. 6 can directly be calculated. Since the same interpolation functions are employed for this element as in the formulation of the shell element, the bending and shell elements are compatible and can be used together effectively to model stiffened plates and shells as illustrated in Section 4.1. 4. SAMPLE SOLUTlONS variable-number-nodes element has been impkmented in the computer program ADINA, and we present here the results of a selection of sample analyses. In Section 4.1 we report on some very simple analyses merely to illustrate the modeling capabilities with the element.
The

4.1 Linear analyses of three cantilevers Three simple cantilevers were analyzed using the shell element. The results of the analysis of a uniform

cantilever subjected to a tip transverse load are listed in Table 5. These results show that the cubic element can be employed without selective or reduced integration with very large aspect ratios, and the element does not display the stiffening effect that is observed with the low-order ekments [2]. The objective in reporting on the second cantilever analysis is to demonstrate the use of the transition element between solid and shell elements. Figure 7 shows the tapered cantilever analyzed, the model employed and the analysis results. In this analysis, a transition element was employed to model the transition region between the relatively thick root and thin tip of the structure. The transition element can be very useful in the analyais of some practical shell structures for which shell-solid regions must be included in the analysis (e.g. analysis ofarch dams and foundations, turbine blades mounted on a shaft) and in the modeling of shell intersections and branches. The third cantikver anal ‘sillustrates the use of the shell ekment in conju J on with the three-dimensional bending ekment in the analysis of stiffened plates and shells. Figure 8 shows the cantilever, the plate model used and the response predicted. The analysis results compare well with the solution calculated using elementary beam theory.

4.2 Linear analysis of a cylindrical

shell

The thin cylindrical shell shown in Fig. 9 was analyzed for its static response. The cylinder is freely supported at its ends and is loaded by two centrally located and diametrically opposed concentrated forces Using the double symmetry of the structure and the loading, only one-eighth of the cylinder was analyzed. This structural problem was employed to study the convergence of the shell element when using different element nodal configurations and increasing the number of elements. Figures 10 and 11 show some displacements and stresses predicted in the finite element analyses. For comparison also the analytical solution is shown [ 171. Figure 10gives ratios of the calculated and the the theoretical displacements for wc and ug. see Fig. 9. It is seen that, as expected, using the lower-order integration in the finite element analyses, in general, the displacements are predicted more accurately. However, Fig 10 also shows that using the cubic element with high-order integration the displacements converge rapidly as the number of elements used in the idealization is increased. Figure 11 shows that for the 6

x 6 element idealizations, the stress distributions are predicted accurately using the &node element with 2 x 2 x 2 Gauss integration and the 16-r&e element with 4 x 4 x 2 Gauss integration. 4.3 Large displacement/rotation analysis of a cantilever A cantilever subjected to a concentrated end moment was idealized using one &node cubic clement. Figure 12 shows the load deflection curves for different displacement/rotation variables. The predicted response shows excellent agreement with the analytical solution [7]. 4.4 Elastic-plastic instability analysis of a column The column shown in Fig. 13 was analyzed for its large displacement elastic-plastic response. Two different finite element idealizations were employed in the study. Namely, one model using six quadratic shell elements (using 2 x 2 x 2 Gauss integration) and another model using twenty-five (i-node isoparametric two-dimensional elements (with 4 x 4 Gauss integration). Figure 13 shows the calculated response of the column using the two finite element idealizations. It is

Using the symmetry of the structure and its loading only one quarter of the structure (one of the beams) was modeled. The finite element model used and the predicted load deflection response of the structure are shown in Fig. 14. The predicted response shows excellent agreement with the analytical solution [18]. Figure 15 shows various equilibrium positions of the structure predicted at different load levels. The deformed shapes of the structure compare very closely to the shapes calculated in [18]. 4.6 krrge displacement analysis of an elastic simplysupported plate The simply supported

square plate subjected to a uniformly distributed pressure shown in Fig 16 was analyzed for its large deflection response. One single 16mode shell element was used to model one quarter of the plate. The total Lagrangian formulation was employed. Figure 16 shows the displacement response predicted in the finite ekment analysis. The computed displacement response is very close to the solutions given by Levy [19], where the effect of using different assumptionson the plate edge in-plane displacements should be noted.

4.7 Elastic-plastic dynamic analysis of a simply supported plate A dynamic analysis of a simply supported square plate subjected to lateral pressure loading was carried out. The Newmark time integration method was used with the time step increment At = T,/48, where T, is the fundamental period of the linear elastic plate. Nine 8-node quadratic plate elements were used to model one quarter of the plate. In a first analysis an elastic and in a second analysis an elastic-perfectly-plastic material was assumed. Figure 17 shows the predicted response for both material property assumptions, and compares the calculated response with a solution given by Liu and Lin [20].

4.8 Large displacement analysis of two shells The large displacement response of two shells was calculated. Using symmetry conditions, the shells shown in Figs 18 and 19 were modeled with only one 1Qnode cubic element. The predicted transverse displacements under the loads are compared in the figures with the solutions of Leicester [21] and Horrigmoe [22]. It is seen that the one cubic element

5. CONCLUSIONS The efficient practical finite element nonlinear analysis of shells requires the use of a shell finite element that is accurate, reliable, and versatile. In this paper a shell element has been presented that is very effective in those respects. The shell element can have a variable number of nodes, it can be employed as a transition element to model shell intersections or shell to continuum transition regions, and it can be used with a compatible bending element to model stiffened shells. The element can be employed in material and geometric nonlinear analysis of plates and general shells in which very large displacements and rotations can be measured. The results of various sample solutions have been given in the paper to indicate the accuracy that is obtained using various element nodal configurations and integration orders. Considering further work on the element. it is desirable that possibilities of improving the element performance in the general analysis of shells using special numerical integration schemes be investigated.
