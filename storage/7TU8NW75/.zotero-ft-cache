ABSTRACT

This report presents the results of an analytical investigation of the ultimate strength of longitudinally stiffened plate panels with plate width to thickness ratios such that the plate buckles before the ultimate strength of the panel is reached. The loading conditions considered are axial loads at the ends and a simultaneous uniformly.distributed load applied laterally. The major element of the panels is a plate having a large widththickness ratio (bit) such that the plate buckles before the attainment of the ultimate axial load. The analysis is performed by solving equilibrium equations numerically with a digital computer. Non-linear effects, non-

symmetrical cross section and inelastic behavior are considered in the analysis. A comparison between analytical results and test

results shows that the analytical method can accurately predict the ultimate load. Information from the numerical analysis has been organized in the form of design curves for steel with a yield stress of 47 ksi and a bit greater than about 45 for the main plate element.

•

Optimum cross sections can be readily obtained through the use of these design curves.

INTRODUCTION

..
A ship hull is essentially a hollow box girder composed of plates stiffened by a grid of longitudinal and transverse members, Fig. 1.1. The deck and bottom plating are stiffened panels which The principal function

serve as flanges of this hollow girder.

of the panels is to resist the longitudinal forces induced by bending of the ship under wave action, Fig. 1.2. The longitudinal

framing resists the bending action and also increases the buckling strength of the outer plating by subdividing it into a series of

..

subpanels.

Because of these advantages many ships use this system

of longitudinal framing. This report deals with the analysis and design of the longitudinally stiffened plate panels which serve as the bottom plating. It considers the panels under the severe loading

condition of axial compression due to bending of the hull combined with a uniformly distributed lateral load. The conventional method used for design of the longitudinally stiffened plate panels is based on elastic considerations. An

allowable stress is chosen as some function of the yield stress of the material and is kept below the buckling stress of the plate elements. A major disadvantage of the method is that the first

yield is not consistently related to the ultimate failure load.

248.18

-2

The design curves and the method of analysis presented in this report are based on the ultimate failure load. This

approach provides a more logical criterion as well as a simpler analysis. In 1965 Kondo presented a theoretical elastic-plastic analysis for the beam-column capacity of longitudinally stiffened plate

panels subjected to an axial thrust and a uniformly distributed lateral loading.

elements that did not buckle. Unlike columns where failure is often instantaneous with

plate panels can sustain axial loads well in excess of the This depends largely on the structural action of

The history of the stability of plates under edge compression dates back to 1891, when Bryan presented the analysis for a simply supported rectangular plate acted upon by a uniformly distributed compressive load on two opposite edges of the plate.** Davidson studied plate action in the P9stbuckling range.(6) He recommended

In the analysis it is assumed that the stress-strain relationship in the plate after buckling can be presented by the average stress vs. edge strain curve for a flat plate. The ultimate

strength of the plate panel is thus obtained without a complex analysis of stresses in the plate. The problem is thus reduced to

an ultimate strength analysis of plate panels which consist of a stiffener and a plate having different structural properties; the stiffener follows an elastic-plastic stress-strain curve while the plate is governed by Koiter's equation in 'the post-buckling range. The analysis becomes complex because it utilizes a non-linear moment-curvature relationship and deals with an unsymmetric cross section. However, the required iteration procedure is readily

handled through the use of a digital computer. Since a design would require repeated use of the method of analysis, it becomes useful to have design curves which would give

use of the method and compares this to experimental test results. The development and use of the design charts is presented in Chapter 4. The Appendix contains detailed information concerning

DEVELOPMENT OF THE METHOD FOR THE DETERMINATION OF ULTIMATE STRENGTH

•
The ultimate strength of longitudinally stiffened plate panels is determined by an analysis which considers
~he

panel as

a beam column with a cross section containing a plate element that buckles. The analysis consists of two main parts; the calculation

of a moment-curvature relationship for a given axial load,
(m-~-P),

which evaluates the response of the cross section to the

given loading conditions, and a numerical integration of small segments to determine the maximum lengths that the panel can have under these loads. The development of the moment curvature relationships is presented in Sec. 2.1. utilizes these 2.1

for the case where the cross section contained plate elements that have width-thickness ratios, (bit), sufficiently low, such that the plate would not buckle until after the ultimate load is reached.(l) Davidson investigated the action of the plate when Tsuijiused this information to develop a

utilized here . Moment-curvature relationships for constant axial thrust, depend on the magnitude of the axial load, the moment, the material properties of the member, namely the yield stresses of the plate and stiffener, the dimensions of the cross section, and the magnitude and distribution of the residual stresses. 2.1.1 Cross Section and Loads

The analyzed cross section is composed of a plate and a series of equally spaced tee stiffeners as shown in Fig. 2.1. The

loads considered are a compressive axial load, pI, acting into the plane of the paper and "a uniformly distributed lateral load, q, on the plate side of the cross section causing compresssion in the plate at the center of the span during bending, (Fig. 2.2). The

ends C and D can either be both fixed or both simply-supported in the analysis that follows. An idealized cross section is used for the analysis (Fig. 2.3). The axial load acting on the idealized cross section is termed P and is a portion of the total axial'load Pl. Similarly the end

moments, m and m , are a portion of the total panel moment, mI. D C The end moments are assumed equal and are called m. In the

idealized cross section the areas of the plate and stiffener flange are assumed to be concentrated about a horizontal line through their

mid-thicknesses.*

The stiffener depth, d, is assumed to be

•

approximately equal to the distance from the mid-thickness of the plate to the mid-thickness of the stiffener flange. 2.1.2 Residual Stresses

An idealized residual stress distribution in the plate is assumed as shown in Fig. 2.4.** The tensile residual stress is assumed to be equal to the yield stress of the plate. The zone

containing this stress is assumed to have a width c, and to be centered about the connection to the stiffener.*** The compressive

residual stress zone spans the remainder of the plate width. For equilibrium, (2.1)

For later convenience this is non-dimensionalized to cr cR c = b cr r C1 yp -- + cr cR cr cR

(2.2)

The stress is assumed constant through the thickness of the plate. ** References 8 and 9 show that this assumption closely approximates the true measured distribution. *~':*Points TTA" denote both edges of the tensile residual stress zone. These points are very important in the stress-strain diagram discussed in Sec. 2.1.5.

the critical buckling stress of the plate.

This equation is appli-

cable only to plates subjected to a uniform compressive stress. The residual stress pattern is not uniform, but since the tensile stress zone is narrow in comparison with the total width, only a small error is involved in assuming that the compressive residual stress crris uniform over the full width. Because the narrow tensile zones have only a small influence on the buckling of the plate, the critical buckling stress is assumed to be reduced by an amount equal to cr r . 2.1.4 Plate Buckling Action

In a typical longitudinally stiffened plate panel, the plate element in Fig. 2.1 is restrained by the stiffeners in the xdirection. stiffeners. It is otherwise considered as simply supported at the When loaded with increasing compressive stresses

with no residual stresSes present, the plate will behave in the manner shown in Yig. 2.5. 1) For low stresses the stress distribution is uniform across the width of the subpanel, (Fig. 2.5a). This

is true until the stress, cr, reaches the critical buckling stress, cr cR ' 2) The plate .begins to buckle at crcR' When the average

stress is increased above cr cR some of the added stress is transferred from the center of the plate to the

248.18

-10

edges (at the junction with the stiffener), (Fig.2.5b). The stresses at the edges then

continue to increase above the stress in the middle until the maximum plate stress is reached. 3) With only a small error the maximum condition occurs when the edge stress reaches the value of the plate yield stress, cr yp ' (Fig. 2.5c). The plate

has then reached its maximum stress and will take no more load.
4)

After reaching its maximum stress, the average plate stress, cravg ' is assumed to remain constant and equal to cr max .

Stress-Strain Diagrams
stress~strain

In the determination of the m-0 relationships,

diagrams for the plate and for the stiffener are very important. Utilizing the plate buckling action, the diagrams chosen are shown in Fig. 2.7. The stress-strain diagram for the plate has 3 steps for the compression range, '(Fig. 2. 7a). The diagram is linear from the

origin to the critical buckling stress which is reached at point T. Koiter's equation then defines the non-linear portion until yielding

248.18

-12

begins at points T!AT! of the cross section.

This occurs for an

average plate stress that never exceeds cryp and is designated by point W on the stress-strain curve. For higher values of strain,

the stress remains constant and equal to (crp)max' The tension range of the stress-strain diagram for the plate is fully elastic-plastic as shown in Fig. 2.7a. The stiffener follows an elastic-plastic relationship between stress and strain for both tension and compression, Fig. 2.7b. 2.1.6 Equations Governing the Moment-Curvature Relationships

Governing the moment-curvature relationships is a series of equations for various conditions of plate buckling action and yielding of the various component elements of the cross section. The equations will now be presented separately for positive and negative bending. A. Assumptions

The following assumptions are made for this analysis: 1) The stress-strain relationships for the stiffener and plate are as described in Sec. 2.1.5 and as shown in Fig. 2.7.
2)

No local instability takes place in the stiffeners prior to the ultimate failure.

3)

The structural action and the loading are identical in all subpanels (between adjacent stiffeners) of the
cro~s

section.

The idealized

248.18

-13

cross section is thus representative of its
·.t

portion of the total cross section.
4)

Stresses in the plate and stiffener flange are constant through their thickness.

5)

The lateral loading is applied uniformly over the plate side of the panel and the moment and axial loading are applied at the centroid of the cross section.

j

6)

The analysis cons,iders the uniformly distributed lateral loading to act as concentrated line loads at the stiffeners. In other words the effect of

plate bending between stiffeners is neglected. 7) 8) Shear deformation is neglected. The distribution of residual stresses does not change over the length. 9) Sections that are plane before deformation remain plane after deformation.
10)

The plate panels are initially flat and there are no initial deformations.

11)
•

The axial thrust is constant along the stiffener, (for m-0 relationships only) .

12)

Plate bending and buckling causes no change in the geometry of the cross section.

248.18

13)

No strain reversal occurs before the ultimate panel load is reached.

14)

Strain hardening effects are not considered.

When

the moment reaches 99 per cent of its maximum value the moment-curvature curve is assumed to have a flat plateau of constant moment for all curvatures. B. Sign Convention

The following sign convention is used for the momentcurvature relationships:
1)
•
2)

Compressive stresses and compressive axial loads are considered positive . Bending moments and curvatures causing compression in the plate are positive.

3)

Plate and stiffener stress and strain values must have correct signs when substituted into the equations. However, positive values are always to

be used for cr ys ,cr yp ,cr c R' and cr p max C. Positive Bending

A general stress distribution in the idealized cross section for positive bending is shown in Fig. 2.8. The axial force

Derivation of Equilibrium Equations

For the derivation of equilibrium equations for small segments of the panel an assumption is made in addition to the assumptions made in computing the moment-curvature relationships (see Sec. 2.1.6); the curvature change along each small segment is assumed to be linear. A small segment is shown in Fig. 2.12. The directions shown

are considered positive. Positive moment is a moment that causes compression in the plate. Curvature can be written as the rate of change of slope with respect to the length along the member ..

section is not symmetric about its bending axis the positive bending moment increases until the maximum plate stress is reached and thus the moment" capacity will increase until this point; afterwards it decreases. In addition, the maximum axial load corresponds to a moment that is not zero, but rather some negative value. due to the non-symmetry of the cross section. This is again

·Figure 3.1 also shows the effect of residual stresses.*

The

maximum positive moment is decreased while the maximum negative moment is increased in magnitude. The corresponding axial loads

differ from the case with no residual stresses. 3.1.2 Moment-Curvature Curves

Figure 3.2 shows the moment-curvature curves for the same cross section for which the moment capacity was discussed.

(2). For high axial loads the. moment is not zero for zero

curvature.

This is exemplified by the axial load .. for no residual stresses. For axial

PiP cr

= 1.80

loads of even higher magnitude the moment tends to remain negative for all values of curvature. (3) The maximum positive moment occurs at a non-zero value of axial load. This was previously discussed

but is better seen physically on this momentcurvature plot. The reducing effect of the residual stresses is again pointed out by the noticeable differences in the maximum moments when high axial loads are reached; for example, PIPer

An important assumption has been made in obtaining these moment curvature plots, and it is very important for the shape of the curves presented here. When the moment reaches 99% of its

maximum value, the moment is "assumed to be essentially constant for all curvatures. The actual structural action and hence the

true shape of the curves is yet unknown in this range. 3.2 Numerical Integration 3.2.1 Typical Ultimate Strength Plots

In fact, an increase in lateral load may slightly

to the change in moment capacity for high axial loads. The effect of residual stresses is also shown in this plot. The dotted lines, (with residual stresses), begin to separate from the solid lines, (no residual stresses), for low axial loads and diverge rapidly for high axial loads. If d/t is held constant the effect of the lateral load q can be seen in Figs. 3.3a and 3.3b where the Q values represent different lateral loads. The effects vClry approximately with the

log of Q such that if t/r is plotted upward on a vertical axis and log Q is plotted to the right, the plot is very nearly linear except for extremely high and very low axial loads where the curves become slightly concave upward. 3.2.2 Effects of Geometric Parameters

The general trends caused by the changes in the various nondimensional geometric parameters will now be briefly discussed. These are utilized in the development of the design curves presented in Chapter 4.

converge to the same maximum axial load as t/r approaches zero. Figures 3.4a and 3.4b show ultimate strength plots for various
bit ratios and for fixed and simply-supported end conditions.

Figure 3.10 shows a comparison with a test performed in 1965 at the Naval Construction Research Establishment, (N.C.R.E.), in Fife.* The test was made on a grillage assembly which had a series of longitudinal panels separated by large transverse members.

ULTIMATE STRENGTH DESIGN CURVES

Development of the Design Curves

~

Steel plate panels having stiffener and plate yield stress values of 47 ksi were chosen as a basis for the design curves.** The ranges of the parameters used are given by Eq. 3.1. These

Reference 5 contains a resume of the use of these design curves. **The yield stress value of 47 ksi corresponds to HTS-47 steel used by the U. S. Navy.·

..

design curves, presented for one yield stress value, display the feasibility of obtaining design curves for plate panels with large b/t. Corresponding design curves for other yield stress values

can be patterned from these curves because of similar parameter interactions. The problem of organizing the data from the computer runs for47 ksi was complicated by irregular interaction of the parameters as caused by unsymmetry of the cross section, non-linear diagrams of stress-strain and moment-curvature, and buckling of a component member. These complications rendered simple formulations impossible.

The method finally resorted to was virtually one of trial-and-error. Various likely modification factors were tried until one was found that nullified the effect of one or more other parameters. This

was continually done until the influence of the parameters could be separated out. Then by proper arrangement of the nullifying

factors a logical pattern was devised to organize the information into a form that is relatively easy to use. Known from loading, geometry, and material parameters are the parameters . cr r , q, cryp , cys, E, pI, t, and B, where pI and B denote r the axial load and width, respectively, for the total the full cross section).

The design curves for simply-supported end conditions utilize plots similar to Fig. 4.1. The effect of plate buckling increases

as bit values get larger, hence in this graph and in the graphs that follow the curves for bit values greater than SO diverge noticeably from. those having bit less than SO. For this reason

the final design curves utilize separate plots for bit <. 80 and bit> 80 (see the center graph in Fig. 4.8).

A typical problem was selected and 10 trial cross sections were computed for this problem by using the design curves. Table 2. tabulates the results of the computations. Some remarks

will be made about this problem to bring forth some interesting points. The average time required to compute all the values shown was 9.8 minutes for each cross section. This represents an appreciable

on longitudinally stiffened plate panels.

Many of the values

,.

computed here would not be computed in normal procedures except in a few tentative cross sections that have been decided upon for further analysis. In addition, the curves for simply-supported

ends require less time than do the curves for the fixed end case that was used here, by virtue of more convenient powers of w in the various formulas used. No criteria were enforced for determining the most advantageous cross section. For instance,if the minimum weight (or area) were However, section

7 requires larger fabrication costs as compared, for example, to section 6 because of the small spacing between the stiffeners that Other requirements such as those imposed on

Inherent in the differences are such

causes as assumptions in the theory, representation of the total cross section by a series of idealized cross sections, torsional effects, etc. The design curves presented in this chapter have families of curves with distinct

errors .caused by representing single curves.*

A check has been made of the percent errors caused

by this substitution. To calculate these percent errors, computer. results were used

for various cases of non-dimensional values of geometry, loading conditions, and material parameters. By assuming arbitrary values

of band B and working backwards, the normal design curve input *The design curves were formulated from many computer runs. After these curves were completed, it was found that the computer program had a slight error. The design curves and the various other graphs presented in this report still retain this slight error. However, the comparisons with test results described in Section 3.3 have been corrected. The discussion of computer programs has also been corrected. The corrected slenderness ratios are always higher "than the previous erroneous results. The differences are generally about 3 percent for fixed end cases and 5 percent for simply-supported ends. The extreme maximum errors are about 6.5% for fixed ends and 8.5% for simply-supported ends. This means that the design curves as presented are slightly conservative and therefore have a small safety factor already applied .

normal way, the TlcomputedTl values of b can be obtained. differences" between the assumed and TlcomputedTl values are considered the errors. These errors are listed in Table 3.

They are not large except Although

"in two specific cases where the axial loads are very low.

the magnitude of error was small for these cases, the percent errors are still large. However, it seems reasonable to say fairly that

the average percent errors are about 1.6 and 2.1 percent respectively
fo~

the simply.supported and fixed ends.

This error could

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR. FUTURE RESEARCH

5~lConclusions

The following conclusions can be drawn from· information presented in this report: 1) The results predicted by the theoretical method of analysis of longitudinally stiffened plate panels with large bit show good correlation with experimental test results. The tests were in some cases

'

..

performed on plate panels as an integral part of a typical grillage structure and also on plate panels as separate members. The good correlation in both

cases shows that this method is sufficiently accurate for design purposes. 2) Design curves were presented for plate panels of steel having a value.
~articular

plate and stiffener yield stress

This shows that design curves are possible for

stiffened plate panels with large bit values, and are feasible for different values of the yield stresses. Due to similar parameter interactions, these other design curves could conceivably be obtained by a pattern similar to the one discussed in the report .
