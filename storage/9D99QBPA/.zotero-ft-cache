Material-based Design Computation
By Neri Oxman Submitted to the Department of Architecture On April 30, 2010 in partial fulﬁllment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Architecture, Design and Computation

ABSTRACT

The institutionalized separation between form, structure and material, deeply embedded in modernist design theory, paralleled by a methodological partitioning between modeling, analysis and fabrication, resulted in geometric-driven form generation. Such prioritization of form over material was carried into the development and design logic of CAD. Today, under the imperatives and growing recognition of the failures and environmental liabilities of this approach, modern design culture is experiencing a shift to material aware design. Inspired by Nature’s strategies where form generation is driven by maximal performance with minimal resources through local material property variation, the research reviews, proposes and develops models and processes for a material-based approach in computationally enabled form-generation. Material-based Design Computation is developed and proposed as a set of computational strategies supporting the integration of form, material and structure by incorporating physical form-ﬁnding strategies with digital analysis and fabrication. In this approach, material precedes shape, and it is the structuring of material properties as a function of structural and environmental performance that generates design form. The thesis proposes a unique approach to computationally-enabled form-ﬁnding procedures, and experimentally investigates how such processes contribute to novel ways of creating, distributing and depositing material forms. Variable Property Design is investigated as a theoretical and technical framework by which to model, analyze and fabricate objects with graduated properties designed to correspond to multiple and continuously varied functional constraints. The following methods were developed as the enabling mechanisms of Material Computation: Tiling Behavior & Digital Anisotropy, Finite Element Synthesis, and Material Pixels. In order to implement this approach as a fabrication process, a novel fabrication technology, termed Variable Property Rapid Prototyping has been developed, designed and patented. Among the potential contributions is the achievement of a high degree of customization through material heterogeneity as compared to conventional design of components and assemblies. Experimental designs employing suggested theoretical and technical frameworks, methods and techniques are presented, discussed and demonstrated. They support product customization, rapid augmentation and variable property fabrication. Developed as approximations of natural formation processes, these design experiments demonstrate the contribution and the potential future of a new design and research ﬁeld.

To imagine is perhaps the most signiﬁcant aspect of an architect’s creative agenda. Much built work and many design artifacts occupy our environment but few stir and shufﬂe the domains of knowledge in a way so fundamental to cultural reorientation. Without imagination, innovation cannot be nurtured. I would ﬁrst like to thank my thesis adviser and mentor, Prof. Bill Mitchell, who taught me that what is not surrounded by uncertainty, cannot be genuine and true; who encouraged me to take risk in deﬁning my search as I question the preconceptions of an era. Thank you, Bill, for guiding me in a journey so charged with curiosity, and thank you for your consistently insightful input. My thesis committee also included Prof. Lorna Gibson and Prof. Woodie Flowers from MIT. To them I owe the recognition of stepping with courage and grace inside my mind and helping direct my search for the origin of form from the point of view of their own respective disciplines. Lorna: I thank you for your patience and perseverance with my task to appropriate and implement concepts and methods from the physical sciences to the domain of digital design. You have provided me with scientiﬁc grounding coupled with a legitimacy to dream up my design ambitions; to me, you shall always remain a precious colleague and a dear friend. Woodie: you are a force of nature. I thank you for your unqualiﬁed support of the creative aspects in my search, and for recognizing the value of design and engineering research as an art form. With faith, you have shaped my thinking and given me courage to take risks driven by curiosity and curiosity alone. I cannot mention Bill and my committee without recognizing Cynthia Wilkes, Bill’s right hand, and a real comrade! Cynthia, without your noble efforts in making feasible my interaction with Bill and the committee, this research would have not been made possible: genuine gratitude for caring and taking action with such an open heart. I came to MIT on a Presidential Fellowship, granted to me by the Department of Architecture upon my arrival. My growth and evolution as a designer and design researcher would have never been made possible without such impressive support. I would like to thank the Dean, Prof. Adele Santos for following my work from its premature and highly conceptual stages (“dreams”), through its reformulation as a ﬁeld of knowledge. I would also like to thank the Department Head, Prof. Yung Ho Chang for humbly insisting that I respect my design intuition and cultivate visions for the future. Very special thanks I shall also extend to the administrative team at the department. Renee: your insightful suggestions and planning strategies have made all of this achievable, in good time and upbeat spirit. Thank you for your eloquence and your guidance. Annette: a very special thank you for making sure I collected and read my mail in time, and thank you for simply being there with an optimism that is challenging to conjure under pressure. While at work, I shared two homes spanning the far edges of the Inﬁnite Corridor between building 9 and building E15. In Building 9, I spent much time with my fellow colleagues at the Computation Group. However, it is mostly due to its directors and faculty that I was able to reﬁne my research both as an academic framework and as an experimental practice. I owe much gratitude to Prof. George Stiny for diligently embracing and promoting experimentalism in design. George, your pro-seminar series has shaped my thinking through the many discussions that we shared about shape grammars and their value in design practice, and in life. I would also like to thank Prof. Terry Knight for her ongoing support and

her friendship during the years that I have spent as a group member. Other faculty to whom I am in debt for creative and intellectual stimulus include Prof. Dennis Shelden, who was one of the very ﬁrst faculty members in the department to present me with the mathematical foundations which later helped inspire a material-based approach to design vis-` -vis the “formalist project” so engrained in contemporary praca tice. Dennis, your lectures and works in the ﬁeld of computational geometry have had an invaluable impact on my thinking, and I look forward, with enthusiasm, to future collaboration. I would also like to thank Prof. Larry Sass for his support and encouragement with regard to the experimental mentality which I have implemented in my work, and more speciﬁcally, its implications on the domain of digital fabrication and construction. Thank you also to Prof. Edith Ackerman with whom I have shared many engaging discussions in various contexts, and who has constantly questioned the cultural and humane signiﬁcance of the production of artifacts. I would like to extend warm gratitude to my countless good friends and colleagues at the Computation Group. Thank you Saeed, Sergio, Kaustuv, Daniel, Kenﬁeld, Mitch, Axel, Yanni, Lira and Maria amongst many others, for your invaluable friendship and support and for cultivating a discourse from the bottom-up that is informed by designing ﬁrst and theorizing later. A special thank you to my friend and colleague Alexandros, with whom I have shared the very ﬁrst discussions regarding the nature of physical matter and its potential contribution to form-generation absent of iconic value yet so charged and thrilling with beauty. Within the Computation Group, I would also like to thank the wonderful administrative team that has supported me. In particular, I would like to thank Daniela Stoudenkova for helping me carry out the Computation Lecture Series of which I have been in charge from 2006 to 2009, with utmost grace and conscientiousness. It was at the Media Lab where I studied and later produced many of the physical models which are included in this thesis. I would like to give special thanks to Prof. Frank Moss, Director, for identifying a voice in my work that was valued and embraced throughout my time at the lab. I would also like to thank Prof. Neil Gershenfeld and his fabulous team at the CBA for allowing me to be productive not without a sense of na¨vet´ . Thank you, Neil, for inspiring me to “make almost anything”. And thank ı e you, fabbers (Manu, Amon, Kenny, Amy and Ara), for guiding me through the lore of milling, cutting, casting, printing and molding. It was in the Media Lab where I had the unique opportunity to examine my ideas within an industrial context and one which celebrates the intersection between the arts and the sciences. I obtained direct and indirect invaluable input from many colleagues. Amongst others, I would like to acknowledge insightful and inﬂuential conversations with Prof. Cynthia Breazeal, Prof. Hiroshi Ishii, Prof. Pattie Maes and,of course, Prof. Nicholas Negroponte and Prof. Tod Machover with whom I have recently had the honor to interact and collaborate in the fun-palace called the Media Lab. I would like to express special gratitude towards my good friend and colleague, Prof. Hugh Herr who continues to present me with intellectual and technical challenges in the scope of the theoretical framework offered by my thesis. I have obtained invaluable insight into my work through its potential applications in the ﬁelds of prosthetic device design and product design in general. More speciﬁcally, I have been inspired by the potential application of the Variable Property Design method in the design of biologically-inspired exo-skeletons and augmentation devices. I look forward to further developing this approach as an alternative framework replacing the now-predominant presence of components and assemblies in the design of wearable devices. Thank you, Hugh, for inspiring me to think above and beyond all boundaries in turning dreams into reality (“this is what we’re here for!”). I would also like to thank Robert Swartz, patent lawyer at the Media Lab for

assisting me in patenting the VPRP technology and recommending interesting industrial paths without compromising the beauty of creative abstraction. Within the framework of my teaching, and research-assistantship at the Media Lab, I have been associated with the Smart Cities Group, directed by my adviser, Prof. Bill Mitchell. I would like to thank those members of the group with whom I have shared discussions about the nature of automobile design and the future of FAB. More speciﬁcally, I would like to thank Peter, Susanne, Ryan, Retro, Arthur, Andres, Will, Dimitris and Michael. Peter: sharing an ofﬁce at the cube with you was a real treat and a rare opportunity to take pleasure in observing creative genius. Within the Media Lab, I wish to extend special gratitude to my UROPS, Rachel Fong and Mindy Eng, who have both worked diligently to help design, fabricate and assemble the ﬁrst prototypes for the a Variable Property 3-D Printer (VPRP). Mindy: your most recent explorations into property driven design fabrication through materials testing, software development and mechanical design have made me realize I am more of a learner than an educator. Thank you for your courage in undertaking work in a ﬁeld so impulsive in its birth and for conﬁrming its academic merit by further developing it. Thank you, also, Marcelo Coelho and Sajid Sadi from the Media Lab’s Fluid Interfaces Group with whom I have collaborated in the context of Transitive Materials: an ongoing research platform promoting an integrated approach to material technology. Sajid, thank you for your friendship and support throughout my thinking and my writing, and thank you for your constructive criticism with which you have an exceptional way. Now, a few thank you notes to teachers, friends and colleagues outside the Department of Architecture. One is tremendously lucky to ﬁnd mentorship by way of cultivating creative commune. Such mentorship is rare to come by and I have been honored to have found one in my good friend and colleague, Prof Craig Carter. Craig: your research and your work, along with the many conversations that we have shared regarding the role of materials and their behavior in the design of objects and buildings, as agents for form-generation predominant to form itself, have helped reﬁne my research ﬁeld as well as inspire the development and implementation of my computational methods. More speciﬁcally, the development of the Finite-Element-Synthesis method, promoting the integration of form generation through analysis and the concept of “digital growth” were inspired by an object oriented FEA environment developed by you and your team at NIST. But, more importantly, you have been a dear friend to me and an inspiration. Thank you for your generosity in time and in knowledge throughout the various stages of the thesis process. Thank you for your collaboration on several of the design projects presented in this thesis; you have encouraged me to think about the generative qualities of each algorithm as they were being conceived. Beyond this, thank you for your sense of na¨vet´ in creative production, without which no creative work ı e can be born. I know we shall share many such exciting projects in the future. From the GSD, I would like to thank Prof. Mohsen Mostafavi and Prof. Preston Scott Cohen for giving me the opportunity to present my work to a community so entrenched in design culture on the other side of Mass Ave. I would also like to thank Prof. Daniel Schodek for his comments and support. Finally, special gratitude to Prof. Sanford Kwinter for being such a noble provocateur and one so thrillingly present in an emerging discourse.

From the Architectural Association in London, I would like to thank Prof. Michael Weinstock for providing me with continuous support and inspiration. Mike, I hope to someday return to the AA to celebrate a new era. A very special thank you to Prof. George Jeronimidis, Director of the Center for Biomimetics in Reading, and Professor at the AA. George: our many discussions regarding the role of heterogeneity and differentiation in Nature have helped me review, structure and demonstrate in a succinct manner, some of the most signiﬁcant ideas that I believe this thesis has to offer. I would also like to acknowledge Prof. Achim Menges for his insight and for his friendship. I have had the great honor to collaborate with various colleagues from a wide array of disciplines. At SOM, Neil Katz has supported and inspired my work into material-based tessellation from which sprang the Tiling Behavior method documented in this thesis. Neil: thank you for urging me beyond parameterization and for appreciating the beauty in things, simply because they are beautiful. Prof. Nancy Cheng has gracefully yet powerfully encouraged me to present my work in CAD conferences such as eCAADe and ACADIA as I exposed and tested some of my research ideas within a scientiﬁc community. Prof. Andrew Kudless has been my good friend and college since we have met at the AA. Thank you, Andrew, for nurturing collaboration so passionate and lively with content. Additional thanks to all of our collaborators on ACADIA 2008: Silicon + Skin and the organizing committee: Prof. Marc Swackhamer, Prof. Billie Faircloth, Prof. Kiel Moe, Prof. David Gissen and the ACADIA community who has helped us shift the discourse. Prof. John Hart: thank you for your continuous collaboration on Construction In-Vivo which won us the HOLCIM award for sustainable construction. I hope to further implement our “breathing walls” in full size prototypes in the very near future as we continue our explorations for appropriating a Material-based Design Computation approach within your own framework of research into nanotubes. Jesse Louis-Rosenberg: thank you for your collaboration on papers and projects leading the way towards the integration of physical matter and digital computational techniques. I still wear your jewelry. I would like to thank the many organizations that have supported my work by allowing me to use their resources and recognized the value of my work by giving me an opportunity to display or demonstrate it publicly. Thank you to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in NY, and speciﬁcally to Paola Antonelli and Patricia Juncosa for curating Design and the Elastic Mind and making Natural Artiﬁce part of its permanent collection. Paola as mentor and friend has done much to teach me the values of technology as the content of cultural traditions and the cultural contribution of revolutionary design experimentalism. Thank you, Francesca von Habsburg, for taking interest in my work and vision and helping me turn it onto a reality to live by (and in!). I look forward to celebrating our new project in Jamiaca. Thank you, Marie Ange Brayer for allowing me to present my work at the BIACS in Seville and for making Raycounting part of the FRAC collection in Orl´ ans. Thank you to the Museum of Science Boston for putting together an e exhibition of my work (At the Frontier of Ecological Design) and for allowing me the unique opportunity to consider the scientiﬁc contribution of my work as valuable to the public. Lisa, Azriel, MJ and Monica: you have all made me feel at home at the intersection of design and science. Thank you to the Media Lab shop managers, John DiFrancesco and Tom Lutz, for letting me conduct wild experiments in the wee hours of the night. Thank you to the Council of the Arts at MIT for supporting me with various grants and exhibitions. Thank you to the HOLCIM foundation for sustainable construction for allowing me the opportunity to test my approach in a technical framework. Thank you to the Earth Awards team for help-

ing me achieve recognition as I completed the ﬁrst prototypes for VPRP (code name: FAB.REcology). Without the support of companies and various corporate sponsors none of the experimental modeling work would have been made possible. Thank you to the following companies: Objet Geometries, ARRK Product Development Group, Tangible Express, Z Corporation and RPM’s Machining for their support and invaluable technical advice in the production of experimental models. A few special and rather eclectic notes of thanks: Thank you John Brockman and Katinka Matson for making me feel at home in EDGE. What has started for me as a manifesto when I was ﬁrst introduced to The Third Culture has now transformed into a new way of thinking. I value your mission and honor its implications on world knowledge and science literacy. Thank you Adam Bly and the SEED team for identifying signiﬁcance in my agenda and making public contemporary design discourse: viva la r´ volution. Thank you, Lee Smolin, for all our intriguing e talks about physics, design and the nature of the universe, a-la Bucky Fuller. You are an inspiration. Enrique Norten: thank you for your long-lasting friendship as I jumped through the hoops of practice and academia, and thank you for your continuous support of the experimental nature of my work. You are a dear friend to me. Thank you to Bruce Sterling who in heroically riding the shaky apog´ e of predictive e journalism in Wired and avante garde European design technology venues has been a distant and valued interlocutor though we have never met or spoken. My close friends have been to me like a secret weapon to get through the hard times, with love and with emotional endurance that is rare to ﬁnd. Jeff: your true friendship has earned me the recognition of what is truly important in life. Thank you for introducing me to The Power of Now and to the idea that being alive and being creative is really the same thing (and thank god for hot yoga!). Rony: your faith in my work and my thesis has kept me going. Your genuine support and friendship provided me with the authority to strive for truly world changing ideas as I step into my new position. I would not have been able to do this without you and I am honored to be a friend to you. Simon: your constant presence and appreciation of my work and my writings have been invaluable. Thank you for pointing me towards awe-inspiring images of Nature and for insisting that I remain true to my intuition. Jay and Jodi: you have both taught me patience and unassuming perseverance during hard times. You have taught me the secrets of ujjayi breath as a matter of being. Nadav and Maya: thank you for reminding me of what it (really) means to be a true Israeli: straightforward, courageous and to the point. Adam: thank you for your long-lasting friendship and for showing me how much can be done with so little. With unspoken heroics, you have set an example for all of us to follow. Eva: you are a kindred spirit to me and I admire your ways of being in this world, as your brilliant future novels will unfold. Thank you for your gift of friendship. Kevin: area code is just but one aspect of your impeccable taste in storytelling and urban living. Thank you for seeing the child in me. To my precious friend Mikey: you have been a best friend to me since the moment I have met you and such you shall forever remain. Thank you for your genuine support with my demanding work; thank you for your patience and your integrity, and thank you for teaching me how to live with a beginner’s mind. A warm expression of gratitude and love to Michal and Moshe Safdie, who have been there for me throughout my triumphs and my struggles: Moshe, your ways have shown me that one can build one’s dreams. I promise to follow humbly. Michal: your graceful friendship and faith in me and my work will

forever give me the will and the power to remain true to my values. And ﬁnally, to my close family, which have been there for me since the very beginning and has relentlessly supported me in every step I took. Keren: You are my best and most precious friend. It is because of you that I left Medical School and found my true love in Architecture. Your art is an inspiration for the world to witness, and I love you and Tomer immensely. Mother: you deﬁne what beauty is. With brilliance, elegance, and humor you have made my life’s journey worthwhile. You have taught me everything I know of the ways of the world and you continue to move and surprise me with your awe-inspiring wisdom and your divine grace. Father: to you I owe everything. Thank you for providing me with a home that is a heaven to the mind and thank you for teaching me that life is not worth living without taking risks. Thank you both, for letting me grow as an individual and for letting me take the road less traveled. It is because of you that I shall never give up my dreams. Osvaldo, my beloved: your unconditional love, your support and your trust in me are beyond anything I have ever experienced. I thank you for giving me the gift of wonder and for making me feel at home within my self. That has made all the difference.

1.1

The Crisis of Form

Over the long trajectory of architectural design history, the design and production of artifacts has been characterized by the growing separation of form-making from its natural foundations in material conditions. In contradistinction to craft production (Sennett 2008) in which material and form are naturally intertwined into a tradition of making, modern design and production have historically evolved away from this integration towards the compartmentalization of form-making as a process independent of its sources in material knowledge. At least since the Renaissance, with the emergence of architectural theories, form-making, as the production of form inspired by theory, has become an autonomous body of knowledge. Within architecture and industrial design, the most culturally sensitive of the productive design ﬁelds, form has grown in both eminence and temporal precedence in the design process to the point that the condition of form preceding materialization has become normative and virtually intuitive in contemporary design culture. With the exception of few pioneering cases in contemporary design, the secularization and debasement of the material realm has become axiomatic. Materiality is, within the logic of the modernist tradition, an agency secondary to form. The Industrial Revolution laid open the door to machine-based manufacturing and mass production. The creation of form was now to be conceived and created by the power of industrial automation; functionality took over as the leading standard and the principal ontology (Jencks 1984). Form was to follow function and ornament, so endemic to craft culture, became crime (Frampton and Futagawa 1980). The values promoted by ancient crafts, pronounced by the integration of material substance and construction methods, once within the province of the craftsman, were abandoned while in their place emerged a design practice based on values of mass production. Fast, cheap, repetitive and modular building types and parts were synonymous with Ford’s visionary dream. Industry’s victory aside, it seemed as if design’s

The Crisis of Form 27

propinquity to ancient crafts and its design expressions as portrayed by vernacular forms of design was now doomed lost; and with it the intimate context of material technologies. Eventually, this non-material approach to the design and the automation of construction were to be reinforced under the command of computer aided design. The digital revolution, which marked the change from analog to digital technology, has transformed the designer’s drafting board into a digital canvas. Form, it seemed, was now divorced completely from the physical reality of its manifestation. Granted, these new design spaces afforded much liberation in terms of formal expression, but it has also broadened the gap between form and matter and made the hierarchical and sequential separation of modeling, analysis and fabrication processes inﬁnitely more pronounced. The implementation and broad absorption of enhanced computational design tools in architectural practice has, since the early nineties, motivated a renaissance of the formalist project in architecture; geometrically complex shapes became emblems of creativity in digital design environments and supported the design mastery of complex geometries in form generation. This formal and geometric design orientation has also addressed “free form” design and architecture along with their enabling technologies as part of the larger design phenomenon of the “mass customization” of “non-standard” form. Today, perhaps under the imperatives of the growing recognition of the ecological failures of modern design, design culture is witnessing a new materiality. Within the last decade in both industrial design and architecture, a new body of knowledge is emerging through various industrial and academic research initiatives (Mitchell and McCullough 1991; Mitchell 2001; Shelden and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dept. of Architecture. 2002). Examples of the growing interest in the technological potential of innovative material usage and material innovation as a source of design generation are developments in biomaterials, mediated and responsive materials, as well as composite materials (McQuaid, Beesley et al. 2005). With the growing relevance of hybridized and mediated materialization, new frontiers of material science as a design science are supporting the emergence of new perspectives in architectural and industrial design. Thus the role of digital design research as the enabling environment of the transformation to a new age of material-based design in various design disciplines has become the cutting edge of computational design research. Here we are at the cusp of the emergence of a new ﬁeld of research at the interaction of Materials Science & Engineering and Design Computation: Material-based Design Computation. Accompanying the rise of what might be termed a new materiality as a phenomenon of the interactions between contemporary developments in scientiﬁc, technological and industrial design culture has been the recognition of the relevance of a unique body of precedents. New research into the forgotten pioneers of what is termed form-ﬁnding processes, that is, the exploitation of material properties and behavior as a source of form-generation in the pre-digital era (Otto, Glaeser et al. 1972; Otto, Herzog et al. 1990; Otto and Rasch 1995; Otto, Nerdinger et al. 2005), are now found to be of growing relevance. Processes in developmental biology and morphology, particularly in the areas of material characterizations of developmental processes, are studied as sources of principles for the design of innovative material structures (Thom 1975; Ruse and Hull 1989; Paton 1992; Goodwin 1994; Kauffman 2000; Kumar and Bentley 2003; Forbes 2004; Bar-Cohen 2006). More speciﬁcally, the notion of mimicking natural structures in the synthesis of new materials and processes has generated enormous interest in both the scientiﬁc and design communities. As this network of knowledge sources and resources develops, a new material sensibility in product and building scale is becoming crystallized and formulated. This new design sensibility carries with it certain potential ecological repercussions and intrinsic values that may be of signiﬁcance in any future implementations of Material-based Design Computation. Material-based Design Computation attempts to inculcate material properties and environmental con-

The following, Notes on the Synthesis of Material Form, outlines the evolution of the scientiﬁc and research rationale of this thesis as well as the components, methods and results of its research. As a means of integrating precedents from diverse ﬁelds into a new uniﬁed ﬁeld of design research, the exposition of the research rationale is divided into a multi-chapter structure. It is, perhaps, the troika structure of its theoretical resources which enlightens the proposal of Material-based Design Computation as a new research ﬁeld: Material-based Design Computation attempts to inculcate material properties and environmental conditions within the computational form-generation processes of design. The following, Notes on the Synthesis of Material Form, outlines the evolution of the scientiﬁc and research rationale of this thesis as well as the components, methods and results of its research. As a means of integrating precedents from diverse ﬁelds into a new uniﬁed ﬁeld of design research, the exposition of the research rationale is divided into a multi-chapter structure. It is, perhaps, the troika structure of its theoretical resources which enlightens the proposal of Material-based Design Computation as a new research ﬁeld: • Nature’s Way, or Natural Design, is seen through the perspectives of morphology Biomimetics. Both of these ﬁelds elucidate Nature’s processes of design as design principles and morphological knowledge which are relevant to the generation of material form; • Material Science & Engineering offers precedents and formalisms for the description of material form and structure. Such precedents, their descriptive formalisms, and their scientiﬁc exactitude provide the foundations for certain of the methods which are required for material-based computational processes; • Design Computation provides models of computation and formalisms of computational representation that can be employed in the research in order to integrate analytical procedures with form generative processes to achieve an approach to design that incorporates material properties as a potential driver of form-generative processes. The unique integration of these three bodies of scientiﬁc and design knowledge contributes to the development of the new ﬁeld of Material-based Design Computation. They constitute the theoretical foundations and the methodological resources of the research which is explicated in Chapters 2, 3, and 4. In proposing an alternative approach to form generation in design, in general, and to architectural and industrial design form generation, in particular, and in demonstrating the potential for a profound transformation of content and methods in design computation, the research assumes as background certain of the core problems of design in an age of mediated technologies. Axiomatic to the awesome proportions of this problem statement are, of course, the reciprocal advantages of the potential effects of this work. In recognizing and repeatedly referring in these pages to the phenomena of “a crisis of form” in architecture and design, the alternative culture of this work promotes natural design and the new materiality as one potential antidote to the “crisis of human environment”. The potential ecological signiﬁcance of this work is profound in its willingness to address certain of the root pathological conditions of the culture of waste by reconsidering the role of materials in design generation and production. 1.1.1 Organization and Structure of Thesis

The thesis is structured in 9 chapters. Following Chapter 1, Chapters 2, 3 and 4, provide for background concepts and ideas from the ﬁelds of Biology, Material Science & Engineering, and Design Computation respectively. Combined, these three chapters make up the background segment of the thesis, laying

theoretical and technical foundations that appear to be useful and signiﬁcant in support of its arguments. More speciﬁcally, Chapter 2 (entitled: Nature’s Way: Material Form and the Structuring of Difference) provides a general approach to the thesis by considering the relation between form and matter in Nature as a model for design generation that is potentially more sustainable than conventional design processes of form-generation and production. Considering natural formation processes relevant to the thesis, this chapter reviews: the hierarchical structure and heterogeneity of properties of biological materials; growth response of biological materials to loading; and the role of anisotropy in biological materials. In Chapter 3 (entitled: The New Materiality: Sources and Development of a Design Cultural Phenomenon) approaches inspired by Nature pointing towards the potential integration between form and material in design are presented, and instrumental deﬁnitions from the domains of material science & engineering are given. Here, engineering materials are considered vis-´ -vis Nature’s Way as the potential substance a to be recomposed and reformed according to principles and methods presented in the previous chapter. The review of engineering materials includes: cellular solids and composites; tiling; functionally graded materials; engineering shape optimization analysis; ﬁnite element analysis and biomimicking. Chapter 4 (entitled: Design Computation: Digital Engines for the Structuring of Matter) provides the technical means by which to consider, conceptualize and implement a new approach to design computation supporting the integration of physical properties within a form-generation environment. The aim here is to review state-of-the-art computational tools, techniques and technologies that carry the potential to support a new approach to design. Chapters 5 through 8 provide the core chapters of the research description: they represent the body of knowledge and experimental frameworks associated with a new design approach entitled Material-based Design Computation. Chapter 5 (entitled: Design Computation: Digital Engines for the Structuring of Matter) lays out the theoretical and technical foundations for the approach, directly followed by Chapter 6 (entitled: Material-based Design Computation: Methodological Frameworks) which presents the methodological frameworks designed to explore some of the issues and questions raised in the previous chapter. Chapter 7 (entitled: Natural Artiﬁce: Experiments in Material-based Design Computation) presents the collection of design experiments, design products and design tools demonstrating the approach of Material-based Design Computation. The designs and implementations presented demonstrate some of the ideas put forth in the earlier chapters of the thesis, especially the notion of material property and thickness variation within form-generation processes. Chapter 8 (entitled: Natural Fabrication: Variable Property Rapid Prototyping Technology) presents a novel technology, designed, developed, and patented to support the theoretical and technical ideas explored through the experiments. It describes a novel rapid prototyping machine allowing the deposition of material with continuous property variation coupled with improved control of material properties over a single fabrication. Chapter 9 (entitled: Contributions: Material Computation: the Foundation of Material Ecology) presents the conclusions, contributions and limitations of the thesis. Combined, the thesis is comprised of three background chapters following the introduction (Ch. 2, 3, 4), four chapters devoted to Material-based Design Computation (Ch. 5, 6, 7, 8), and a concluding chapter(Ch. 9). 1.1.2 Organization and Structure of Introduction

The following introductory sections are organized according to the structure of this thesis; each section represents one out of the nine chapters that make up this work. Each section carries the title of its respective chapter and within it, a short summary.

1.2

Nature’s Way: Material Form and the Structuring of Difference

Chapter 2 is set out as an explication of the intimate relation between material, structure and form in Nature, and ways by which such integration is achieved. Principles of natural form as a function of performance are reviewed and considered as potentially providing design guidelines. The main assertion is that in Nature, material is heterogeneously distributed to ﬁt its structural and/or environmental performance, and that such structural heterogeneity (also termed difference, or differentiation) is made possible due to the integration between form, structure and material (Figure 1.1). Two case studies focusing on trees and bones, and representing classes of ﬁber-structures and cellular solids are reviewed, and related instrumental deﬁnitions are presented and discussed. The remodeling of bone tissue as it responds to functional demands of mechanical loading is presented alongside similar processes observed in a fully functioning wood tissue. The advantages of material distribution and structural heterogeneity as observed in Nature are discussed and proposed as an alternative strategy to conventionalized design processes of form-making. This strategy stands in contrast to the current state of design of homogeneous components from lower level assemblies where a singular material lacking variation in thickness or proerty, is assigned to a given shape. Finally, some design dichotomies that are unpronounced in Nature (such as the dichotomy between structure and material) are discussed and speculations regarding their signiﬁcance to design are presented. The overarching principle brought forth is that contrary to a form-ﬁrst approach in design, in Nature the typical hierarchical design sequence form-structure-material is typically inverted bottom-up as material informs structure which, in turn, informs the shape of “naturally designed” specimens (Vincent 1982). By the end of this chapter we ask: how can a material ﬁrst approach, prioritizing environmental performance and material behavior over form, be accommodated by design, and in what stages of the design process can such an approach be implemented? What new design possibilities emerge, and what might their potential signiﬁcance be? 1.3 The New Materiality: Sources and Development of a Design Cultural Phenomenon

The chapter begins by suggesting that the disintegration between form, material and structure, so emblematic of contemporary design has lead to a parallel disintegration in design method pronounced by the partitioning between modeling, analysis and fabrication. Such disintegration, as we shall claim, may potentially result in the prioritization of expressive shape over environmental performance. Compared to Nature, our own material strategies appear to be much less effective, and generally quite wasteful. Since the industrialized age, the construction industry has been dependant on discrete solutions for distinct functions (Oxman 2008; Oxman 2008; Oxman 2008). Building skins are a great example of such a claim. Steel and glass possess signiﬁcantly different structural and environmental properties which relate to signiﬁcantly different performance requirements. Diversity is achieved by sizing, rather than by substance variation, and it is typically mass produced, not customized. As far as material structuring is considered, in the artiﬁcial world, especially in the construction industry, one property ﬁts all. As we shall demonstrate, the assumption that discrete solids are made from single materials is deeply embedded in modernist design thinking, and typically unquestioned. Furthermore, it is enforced by the way that industrial supply chains work. At their lowest levels, supply chains are driven by component manufacturing processes performed by highly specialized machines operating on particular materials to produce low-level subassemblies. But can Nature’s ability be emulated in the design of the artiﬁcial? With the assistance of advances in structural and material engineering entering contemporary digital practice, design culture appears poised for transformation (Figure 1.2). Designers now seek to advance

The New Materiality 31

Nature’s strategies in structuring matter by designing synthetic multifunctional materials competing with evolutions unrestricted time-frame of design process. Fitness, not form, is what actually matters. In Chapter 3 the new materiality is recognized by proposing that in mimicking Nature’s way, materials are to be designed for highly customized functions rather than simply be selected and assigned to preconceived shapes. This requires the transformation from a culture of material selection to one of material design, as well as the utilization of heterogeneous and variable properties that may potentially correspond to a given set of performance criteria. The main aim of the chapter is to introduce certain design principles in material practice in which the control and structuring of material organization is informed by material performance constraints. Later we shall see how those principles may come to express themselves in the digital domain, and then to be further combined with shape-generation processes to foster seamless relations between material behavior and geometry. Given Nature’s way, which prioritizes the function of structural and environmental performance as the forces shaping matter into shape (and not the other way around), the chapter suggests ways in which to consider a graduated properties approach to materials characterized by structural heterogeneity across scales as it may correspond to various loads and constraints. Designed anisotropy is suggested as the path into a more biologically inspired method for informed material distribution. This ability, it is proposed, will ultimately allow the designer to design materials that vary their properties in correspondence with the forces acting upon them. Indeed, the design world is swiftly catching up with Nature’s secrets by engineering variable density materials. Such materials are responsive in the sense that their microstructure is optimized to speciﬁc performance requirements (such as mechanical loads) as demonstrated through the family of functionally gradient materials. Moreover, there exist numerous examples of products and building components which have been fabricated and manufactured by means of varying material properties across volume sections to correspond with structural loads and other stimuli. This was the predominant method of all forms of craft throughout history. With the composites industry undergoing massive expansion, many industries are revisiting the role of materials in the shaping of products such as automobiles, airplanes, sail boats and so on. Case studies from both ancient and contemporary periods are reviewed and discussed in relation to their form-generation processes. The dichotomy between overall structural shape and local material properties is addressed, alongside other dichotomies presented in Chapter 2. Finally, certain limitations of material-based design are addressed pointing towards the shift from material selection to material design and its potential signiﬁcance in the digital domain as part of the form-generation process. 1.4 Design Computation: Digital Engines for the Structuring of Matter

The treatment of materiality by CAD follows from certain of the presuppositions presented in the previous chapters. In this light, traditional CAD and BIM systems are fundamentally limited in their capacity to represent graduated or continuously heterogeneous material properties. Their basic strategy is simply to assign a material property to a closed solid or a closed surface polygon. In this respect, such tools are rather limiting to designers who wish to explore and design with graduated properties. Indeed, since its emergence in the 1960’s, computer aided design (CAD) in its many transformations has afforded the designer with an almost effortless manipulation of shapes generally detached from their fabrication in material form (Figure 1.3). Such processes promote the application of material subsequent to the generation of form. Even when supported by high-ﬁdelity analytical tools for analysis and optimization, these processes are predominantly linked to geometrical manipulations in three dimensions. Design

32 NOTES ON THE SYNTHESIS OF MATERIAL FORM

culture now requires a shift from a geometric-centric to a material-based approach in computationally enabled form-generation. The main argument presented in this chapter is that certain design conventions prior to the age of digital design have been preserved and re-appropriated in CAD. Such, for instance, is the notion that a product or a building is typically made up of lower level components and parts put together by higher-level assemblies. Each component is geometrically designed as a structural element (i.e. post, beam, or surface element) and then assigned its material. The objective of Chapter 4 is to review the evolution of concepts and issues in design-computation that are relevant to the integration of physical parameters within digital form-generation, analysis and fabrication environments and explore their potential to support a seamless integration between matter and shape. Certain computational paradigms inspired by Nature and the physical world are proposed as relevant to this objective and their limitations presented. Current methods for material representation in design are reviewed in both generative (modeling) and synthetic (analysis & fabrication) computational environments. Voxels, maxels, ﬁnite-elements, particles and vague-discrete modeling elements are presented as potential “digital units” that may incorporate local physical information as informed by environmental constraints. The chapter concludes with the limitations presented by computational media to represent more than a singular physical property. In addition, and more signiﬁcant to the research objectives, computational tools with physical orientation are currently mainly used for purposes of optimization rather than processes of form-generation. However, if such computational units could potentially represent variable properties and could also be assembled as a function of structural and environmental performance, a new approach to design supporting performance-oriented form-generation processes could be developed and implemented. 1.5 Material-based Design Computation 1: Theoretical and Technical Foundations

Deﬁned as the process of computationally enabled form-ﬁnding, informed by material properties and environmental constraints, Material-based Design Computation promotes an integrated approach to design, whereby material properties inform the geometrical generation of three- dimensional form. Chapter 5 introduces the theoretical and technical foundations of Material-based Design Computation developed to support a new universal approach to the problem of digital form-generation with continuously varying material properties satisfying prescribed material conditions on a ﬁnite collection of material features and global constraints. Research assumptions, goals, objectives and questions are deﬁned and presented, addressing ways by which to achieve the integration of physical considerations within the generation of form in order to efﬁciently distribute materials and properties relative to the type of forces deﬁned by the environment. This condition assumes a given material volumes to which are assigned various forces resulting in its reorganization of physical distribution and property variation. Given the assumption that a graduated properties approach to the design of objects and buildings also appears to be of certain potential value to the emerging ﬁeld of sustainable design in its promotion of environmental customization, we seek to deﬁne, explore, demonstrate and evaluate computational processes supporting such goals. The aim is to arrive at a design approach favoring high levels of customization over mass production; integrating between modeling, analysis and fabrication environments; utilizing a graduated property approach to the design of objects; and overall prioritizing material considerations over geometric expression.

Material-based Design Computation 2: Methodological Frameworks

Chapter 6 presents a set of methodological frameworks corresponding to the goals, aims, issues and questions introduced in the previous chapter. Experimental design methods and models are applied both to generate and to evaluate the design experiments illustrated in the following two chapters. These methodological frameworks focus on the two reoccurring themes that were identiﬁed as endemic to natural design: the achievement of the multi-functional / mass-customized artifacts through a graduated material property approach, and the exploitation of an integrated conception-construction process in order to achieve computationally-enabled form-ﬁnding environments. Both of these objectives are intimately related. The methodological frameworks include the development of three concepts relevant and instrumental to the experimental work carried out and presented in Chapters 7 and 8. These concepts include a variable-property modeling concept, the concept of property, and distribution-driven digital anisotropy, and ﬁnally, the concept of computational material units, also entitled material pixels. The variable property design environment (VPD) is a design approach, a methodology, and a technical framework, by which to model, simulate and fabricate material assemblies with varying properties designed to correspond to multiple and continuously varied functional constraints. Such capability is later also termed synthetic anisotropy pointing towards the designer’s ability to strategically control the density and directionality of material substance in the generation of form. In this approach, material precedes shape, and it is the structuring of material properties as a function of performance that anticipates their form. The theoretical and technical foundations for this approach have been termed, Material-based Design Computation. Material units are presented and deﬁned per a given design environment: within modeling processes, the designer may consider tessellation strategies that are property-driven (as opposed to the now classical curvature-driven approach); within analytical processes, the designer may consider a mesh unit to correspond to more than one objective function (i.e. load and light); and, within fabrication processes, the designer may consider a “material pixel”, also referred to in the literature as a “maxel”, as a unit negotiating between digital modeling units and units of physical fabrication. These three environments (modeling, analysis and fabrication) correspond respectively to the methodological frameworks offered by tiling behavior, ﬁnite synthesis method and variable property fabrication. Various deﬁnitions of material pixels are given as a function of the type of performance requirements that are considered (e.g. pressure maxels respond to load, thermal maxels to heat, light maxels to light, comfort maxels to physiological requirements, and so on). 1.7 Natural Artiﬁce: Experiments in Material-based Design Computation

The mechanical response of physical forms driven by, and engineered with, spatial gradients (heterogeneity, or difference) in composition and structure appears to be of considerable signiﬁcance in all sub disciplines of design: from architecture, to product design, to material design as well as to the technologies to fabricate and construct them. Chapter 7 illustrates a series of experiments in Material-based Design Computation in the design of various objects under diverse environmental conditions; these include as a culmination of the range of experiments the comprehensive design of two functional products. It is important to note that each project utilizes a particular methodological framework or some combination of multiple methods. The research is experimental, and various methods are experimentally implemented at various phases of the design process in order to systematically and comprehensively explore the research issues and questions presented. The design experiments presented in this work are ordered and classiﬁed by the type of performance

34 NOTES ON THE SYNTHESIS OF MATERIAL FORM

considerations which they address. Monocoque, Cartesian Wax, and Stalasso all prototypes for architectural structural skins, explore the generation of 3-D forms as they may be informed by loading conditions. Subterrain and Fatemaps are informed by heat; Tropisms and Raycounting explore the generation of form as it may be informed by light. The concluding and comprehensive experiments with design projects include Beast - a chaise lounge, the texture-form of which is informed by both loading and comfort constraints, and Carpal Skin a protective splint against carpal tunnel syndrome designed to control muscular movement and provide comfort. Following the presentation of design experiments and projects, special focus is given to several key projects implementing relevant “methodological frameworks” in the previous chapter. A tiling behavior approach is demonstrated in the design of Beast; the ﬁnite synthesis method is demonstrated in the design of Raycounting and Subterrain. Following this, all design experiments and projects are classiﬁed according to the type of method and form-generation processes used. 1.8 Natural Fabrication: Variable Property Rapid Prototyping Technology

Chapter 8 is devoted to the development of a fabrication environment and technology designed to achieve variable property fabrication. The objective is to enable the direct connection between material design and fabrication, or, in other words, the link between materiality and materialization. The design experiments and products developed and implemented in Chapter 7, all share in common the concept of gradual material variations informed by performance constraints. Instead of lower level components put together into higher level assemblies, and made from homogeneous parts, all projects exemplify the notion of property variation through the implementation of ideas such as structural heterogeneity and controlled material distribution. These experiments were supported by the Material-based Design Computation method and techniques allowing for the integration of material considerations as part of the form-generation process within the digital domain. However, all projects were eventually fabricated using existing rapid fabrication techniques. Currently, in architectural design fabrication, there exists no rapid prototyping technology which allows for a continuous modiﬁcation of material properties such as strength, stiffness, density and elasticity as continuous gradients across the surface and volume area of a functional component. Such variations are usually achieved as discrete changes in physical behavior by printing multiple components with different properties and distinct delineations between materials. In these cases, assembly typically begins only after the fabrication process has been completed. Such processes result in material waste and lack of functional precision. Variable Property Rapid Prototyping aims at implementing a novel material deposition 3-D printing technology which offers gradation control of multiple materials within one print to save weight and material quantity while reducing energy inputs. The result is a continuous gradient material structure, highly optimized to ﬁt its structural performance with an efﬁcient use of materials, reduction of waste and the production of highly customized features with added functionality. VPRP ultimately aims at signiﬁcantly reducing material and energy waste in the design of products and buildings by constructing structures with varied properties using lighter, stronger materials and avoiding redundant deposition. The aim is that such products will be designed to use signiﬁcantly less fossil fuel energy to construct and operate than they would typically consume. The chapter brieﬂy reviews current state-of-the-art fabrication technologies and their environmental disadvantages. Unlike Nature’s way where high levels of environmental customization are achieved through property variation, contemporary design methods and products are characterized by material assemblies of homogeneous components. Current construction supports this logic. The development of a new technology entitled variable property rapid prototyping (VPRP) is presented which allows the designer to print materials with varied properties (i.e. density, elasticity, etc). The

Natural Fabrication 35

ultimate aim is to combine such fabrication technology with a variable property modeling environment whereby computational units (“material pixels”) and physical fabrication units are calibrated with, and according to, particular performance requirements (i.e. as is the case of bone). Following a short survey, the variable proper6ty fabrication software environment is presented, where a color-coded control module represents the means by which to vary material properties continuously. Hardware modules are reviewed: general technical descriptions are given to the various parts of the machine. The chapter concludes with the technologys current limitations and future outlook towards a more natural fabrication inspired by Nature’s way. Finally, it is suggested that the VPRP as a pilot project aims at revisiting design fabrication technologies as approximations to natural formation processes that take in unformed raw materials and operate on them locally; using a single parameterized and digitally controlled process rather than many specialized processes, to produce formed solid objects. In this way, one is able to break free from the rigid logic of industrial supply chains and related CAD systems. 1.9 Contributions of Material-based Design Computation

Chapter 9 considers the theoretical, methodological and technical contributions of the thesis. Theoretical contributions refer to the development, deﬁnitions and implications of Material-based Design Computation as a design method, technique and fabrication technology prioritizing materials and environmental performance over a purely geometrical rendition of shape. Unlike current design processes where form dominates matter, design based upon the interrelation between materials and performance promotes the design of objects with graduated properties perfectly distributed and highly customized to ﬁt their function. It is anticipated that such an approach will offer new possibilites for design and potentially enhance a new sensibility to sustainable design as we know it. Methodological contributions relate to the body of knowledge of Material-based Design Computation which aims at implementing the theoretical approach within a computational environment fostering material-informed form generation processes. More speciﬁcally, methodological contributions refer to the methods and technical means supporting this design approach through the introduction of design methods and environments included under the categories of tiling behavior, ﬁnite element synthesis, and variable property fabrication. Through a series of design experiments, the thesis has demonstrated the integration of geometry, structure, and material not as separate elements of design, but rather as a multiplicity of design drivers acting together to generate form. Beyond the developments of scripts and programs to realize the collection of design work presented in this thesis, technological contributions mainly refer to the development of a new fabrication technology entitled variable-property rapid prototyping enabling the distribution of material properties as continuous gradients within a 3-D printing environment. Both variable property modeling and fabrication of materials with heterogeneous properties across a wide range of scales and applications holds a profound place in the future of design and engineering. The ability to synthetically engineer and fabricate materials using VPRP strategies appears to be incredibly promising as it increases the product’s structural and environmental performance, enhances material efﬁciency, promotes material economy and optimizes material distribution. The fundamental technical contribution is a ﬁrst-generation rapid manufacturing tool for depositing material with gradually varying physical properties such as density or elasticity per unit volume informed by structural and environmental ﬁtness constraints. The technical contributions of the thesis are summarized in Chapter 9 and include the analysis of forms allowing material property variation in response to mechanical, thermal, or lighting conditions; fabrica-

tion of forms with material property or thickness variation over a surface; and the development of a new device, the Variable Property Rapid Prototyping machine, for fabricating forms with varying material properties and thickness. Following the main content of the chapter is an assessment of current limitations and future research. Certain fundamental question of “the origin of form” is re-addressed in the context of the design experiments presented. An important assumption underlying this research is that form may be generated without explicit a priori geometrical content, but rather as the byproduct of matching material parameters and environmental constraints. The main design model proposed in this thesis supports such a process by considering the landscape of design possibilities as the interaction between force and matter, and between energy and matter. Eco-maxels are conceived of as the units by which to technically achieve such a new concept of design.

As demonstrated by the luteus, Nature’s Way (chapter 2) will unfold Nature’s form-generation strategies characterized by achieving high levels of environmental customization. In Nature one ﬁnds complete integration between shape, structure and material. Such integration, as we shall argue, is achieved by the assimilation between formal generation, adaptation and growth analogous to modeling, analysis and fabrication in the design of the artiﬁcial.

“In her (nature’s) inventions nothing is lacking, and nothing is superﬂuous.” — Leonardo da Vinci

2.1

Why Nature?

Nature is demonstrably sustainable. Her challenges have been resolved over eons to enduring solutions with maximal performance using minimal resources. Unsurprisingly, Nature’s inventions have eternally inspired human achievements and have led to the creation of exceedingly effective and efﬁcient materials and structures, as well as methods, tools, mechanisms and systems by which to design them. Insights gained from the study of natural materials are signiﬁcant, not only from a scientiﬁc perspective, but also in the context of their application to the design of synthetic environments. In this chapter we review and discuss the main characteristics of Nature’s forms. This is a challenging mission when carried out from the point of view of design, since the phenomenon of growth alone occupies such vast implications in considering form’s origins: we are yet to grow a building. Despite this, I aspire to examine Nature’s creations and to demonstrate that in Nature’s way there is always a direct relation between matter and energy, between form and environment, and between organ and function. When considering natural forms and materials from a design perspective, it is therefore important to note the strategies and mechanisms by which Nature goes about distributing materials and properties to account for its functions as she maintains the forms of life on earth.

Why Nature? 41

2.2 2.2.1

Sustainable by Nature: Principles Minimum Inventory Maximum Diversity

In Structure in Nature Is a Strategy for Design Peter Pearce presents a concept by which he elucidated Nature’s sustainable ways. He refers to this as the concept of Minimum Inventory - Maximum Diversity (Pearce 1981) which underlies every natural system. Such systems are deﬁned by Pearce as minimized inventories of component types, a kit of parts, along with rules by which to combine these components. The ﬁt systems are those described by the contribution of their components to the maximization of different, though generically related, structural forms. Furthermore, in successful systems the rules of assemblage and the physical components themselves are seen as organically related such that the rules are seen to grow out of the parts, and the parts grow out of the rules.

2.2.1.1

Natural Systems

Snowﬂakes, for instance, exhibit great diversity of form, governed by certain physical, geometrical and chemical constraints. The snowﬂake is considered an archetype according to Pearce, of physio-geometric expression: within the six-fold form no snowﬂakes have ever been known to be exactly alike. The case of crystals is similar. Here one ﬁnds the expression of the diversity of form as a function of the least-energy internal arrangement of atomic arrays.

2.2.1.2

Biological Systems

In biological structures, the DNA molecule suggests a minimum inventory-maximum diversity principle from a biomechanical interaction point of view (Pearce 1981). Natural materials are made from a relatively small number of polymeric and ceramic components or building blocks, some of which are themselves composites (Vincent 1982). The solid part of most plants for example is made up of cellulose, lignin and hemi-cellulose, while animal tissue is largely made of collagen, keratin, chitin and minerals such as calcite, hydroxyapetite and aragonite. From these, Nature fabricates a remarkable range of structured composites (Vogel 2003). In these cases, as in many others, a singular generic system constrained by its inventory promotes maximum diversity.

2.2.2

Resource Conservation

The formative process in natural structures is typically characterized by least-energy responses. Such is the principle of closest packing, a principle common to both the animate and inanimate world. Interestingly, the principle of closest packing is equivalent to that of triangulation, and it is a well known fact that triangulated frameworks exhibit inherent geometric stability (Thompson 1942; Pearce 1981). Such properties enable framework structures to be built without moment joints, insuring axially loaded members. This, in turn, results in high strength per weight minimum energy structures2.1 . Such a principle is of remarkable universality: it operates independently of scale or material with the same energetically conservative effect. Whether on the molecular level, the cellular level, or at the man-made structure level, its inherent stability always establishes a condition of minimum potential energy.
2.1

In this context, consider Alexander Graham Bell’s tetrahedral kites and space frames.

42 NATURE’S WAY

2.2.3

Minimum Energy

Nature creates forms and structures according to the requirements of minimum energy (Thompson 1942). She does so as a response to the forces and loads as she creates a great diversity of forms from an inventory of basic principles and a few materials. Furthermore, Thomson claims that the form of an object is analogous to the diagram of forces deﬁning it. Such is a governing idea in the application of the minimum inventory-maximum diversity principle to building system design. But, how are such principles implemented in the natural world from a materials perspective? There are many ways by which to consider Nature’s material strategies. For the designer, there is particular interest in two of Nature’s many various traits which are deﬁned in the following section. 2.3 2.3.1 Sustainable by Design: Strategies Integrated Multi-criteria Environmental Performance: Load, Light, and the Seasons

In considering Natural material usage, it is challenging to distinguish between structure and skin, since so many of Nature’s forms assimilate between varied functions and their related materials and properties. Look at your skin and you will quickly realize that within one continuous tissue we are constantly in negotiation between seemingly contradictory functions as we consider the skin as both barrier and ﬁlter. Indeed, the skin has signiﬁcant structural properties which allow it to fulﬁll its multiple functions. These functions include energy capture (i.e. insect compound eye), color generation (i.e. scales of butterﬂy wings), heat transfer (i.e. penguin feathers), mass transfer, drag reduction (i.e. shark skin), surface adhesion (i.e. contac splitting in gecko foot), surface repulsion, sensing, actuation, and so on. The one common denominator for all of these examples is that they are all constructed of complex ﬁber structures. Indeed, natural structures possess a high level of seamless integration and precision with which they serve their functions. A key distinguishing trait of nature’s designs is the capability in the biological world to generate complex ﬁber structures of organic, or inorganic, multifunctional composites such as shells, pearls, corals, teeth, wood, silk, horn, collagen, and muscle ﬁbers (Benyus,1997). Combined with extracellular matrices, these structural biomaterials form microstructures engineered to adapt to prearranged external constraints introduced into them during growth and/or throughout their life span (Vincent 1982). Such constraints generally include combinations of structural, environmental and corporeal performance criteria (Figure 2.1). Since many biological materials are made of ﬁbers, their multi-functionality often occurs at scales that are nano through macro and typically achieved by mapping performance requirements to strategies of material structuring and allocation. The shape of matter is therefore directly linked to the inﬂuences of force acting upon it (Vogel 2003). Material is concentrated in regions of high strength and dispersed in areas where stiffness is not required. It is a well known fact that in nature shape is cheaper than material, yet material is cheap because it is effectively shaped and efﬁciently structured. Nature’s ability to gradually distribute material properties by way of locally optimizing regions of varied external requirements, such as the bone’s ability to remodel under altering mechanical loads (Figures 2.2, 2.3) or the wood’s capacity to modify its shape by way of containing moisture, is facilitated, fundamentally, by its ability to simultaneously model, simulate and fabricate material structuring. The structural properties of wood, for instance, not unlike most biological materials, can widely vary when measured with the growth grain or against it such that its hardness and strength may differ for a given sample when measured in different orientations (Figure 2.4, 2.5)2.2 .
2.2 This property is known as anisotropy and it is due to anisotropic structuring that nature can create sustainable structures efﬁciently. We shall return to explain this trait in depth in the following chapter along with relevant examples.

Sustainable by Design: Strategies 43

2.3.2

Integrated Environmental Processes: Growth, Response, and Adaptation

Millions of years devoted to the ﬁne-tuning of the relation between structure and function have resulted in Nature’s remarkable solutions to complex structural-mechanical problems (Weiner and Wagner 1998)2.3 . Moreover, natural material systems and structures are capable of changing their properties, shape, color, and load paths to account for varying structural and environmental constraints as well as to handle damage and promote repair. Their survival depends on Nature’s ability to negotiate between multiple functions and evaluate their relative signiﬁcance within a singular process integrating the mechanisms of growth, response and adaptation. Furthermore, it turns out that rather than optimizing its resources for a single objective function, nature must instead negotiate multiple functions by means of one single material system. The survival of such systems depends on Nature’s ability to manage and promote the economic viability of her constructions, as well as satisfying a set of desired mechanical properties such as strength, stiffness, toughness and resistance to impact. In addition to form-generation and response through analysis, one of the most unique features of biological systems is their capability to diagnose and repair localized damage to their structures. Clearly, such an attribute is desirable for man-made objects2.4 . It is, however, important to state that natural processes of formal generation, analysis and fabrication are well integrated precisely because they can afford to be given the time-scales afforded by evolution. Gordon notes that both shape and material of any natural structure have evolved over a long period of time in a competitive world and represent an optimization with regard to the loads which it has to carry and to the ﬁnancial, or the metabolic, cost (Gordon 1976). Still, it is our mission here to understand the relationship between generation, analysis and fabrication as it is applied to the formation of natural specimens in order that we might further speculate upon how such approaches may be implemented in design. It is always thrilling to discover the extent of impact that the physical sciences had from the 1930’s onward on modernist designers who found inspiration in the life sciences; more fascinating however is the acknowledgement of the converse condition in which the scope of impact that the design disciplines had on protagonists of the natural sciences is well celebrated. Such was the case of natural inclination that the ecologist Julian Huxley’s had towards Walter Gropius, the former Bauhaus director who at that time ﬂed Nazi Germany as he and fellow faculty relocated in London2.5 . Alongside Gropius was L´ szl´ a o Moholy-Nagy former head of the school’s metal workshop and renowned artist who, much like his fellow radical designers, who sought to unify the arts and the crafts with industrial universalism, found new voices as well as patrons in a community of biologists in London who adapted Bauhaus architecture and art as part of their scientiﬁc vision for the future (Anker 2006)2.6 .
Here one has to bear in mind that despite evolution’s unconstrained timeframe, biological structures are not always perfectly adapted to their function. This is partly due to the fact that beyond the mechanical function of materials, some, if not all, of them must fulﬁll other functions as well. 2.4 However, using energy to increase stiffness is not always the most “natural” solution. Nature uses strain energy as a damage control mechanism by designing systems with large strain capabilities as compared to our modern constructs of steel, concrete, and graphite. Adaptation of structural impedance is perhaps the most fundamental and powerful concept of intelligent materials systems. By modifying the structural impedance of a system, we can change its vibration and acoustic behavior as well as change its resistance to damage. 2.5 Julian Huxley was then secretary of the Zoological Society of London. He had an apartment at the zoo, which he used partly as a showroom for modernist design. Here, scientists, artists, architects, environmentalists and the science-ﬁction writer H. G. Wells regularly met for discussions about how to save humankind from environmental, economic and social destruction (Anker 2006). 2.6 Bauhaus design was one of the group’s chief passions, and Gropius looked to Huxley and his friends with hope and admiration. Traditional architecture and design reinforced an unfortunate dualism between people and nature, Huxley believed, whereas the Bauhaus approach promised a harmonious reunion. To Huxley, nothing less than the evolutionary survival of the

In this circumstance Moholy-Nagy found a major source of inspiration in Raoul Franc´ . Franc´ is known e e to have founded the science of bionics with the motivation and claim that humans must learn how to copy Nature’s inventions in order to survive on earth. This new science was ﬁrst named Biotechnik ’bio-technique’ (Anker 2006). Moholy-Nagy’s students and fellow designers were instructed by him to view Nature as a “constructional model” and to search for “prototypes in nature” in order to better determine functional design. He proposed that all human technologies are based in natural technologies. Moholy-Nagy himself studied the works of Huxley and his colleagues and used it to generate his own principles, techniques and processes as they might be applied to human design. His 1935 ﬁlm In the Cradle of the Deep documents the growth of lobsters and the ﬁsherman’s struggle to search them out. He argued that a “prehistoric animal shell is constructed in such a wonderful way that we could immediately adapt it to a ﬁne Bakelite2.7 or other molded plastic form”. The point of the ﬁlm was to show designers that observing the life of animals may well instruct designers how form follows function. Furthermore, Nagy’s investigations into architecture and photography were also informed by the life sciences. He deﬁned architecture “as an organic component of living” and argued that “architecture will be brought to its fullest realization only when the deepest knowledge of human life in the biological whole is available” (Anker 2006). 2.4.2 Biomimetics

With respect to this underlying motivation to translate natural, and particularly, growth, processes into design principles, Biomimetics is an emerging ﬁeld the objective of which is to study design solutions to problems in the natural world as potentially relevant to contemporary design and engineering. According to Klein, B.M. Katz has deﬁned the ﬁeld as the study of natural processes and how they can be emulated to solve human problems in a life-friendly, waste-free way (Klein 2009). There it is stated that in contrast to genetic engineering which turns cellular organisms into factories for industrial production, biomimetics tries to turn society’s productive resources into agents of nature. The natural world is treated as a library of ideas. J.F. Vincent, one of a small number of acknowledged experts in the ﬁeld, deﬁnes it simply as, “the abstraction of good design from nature” (Vincent 1990). Although this sounds obvious, in fact, it involves much more complex intellectual and research-related processes. Although the ﬁeld of Biomimimetics can be traced to Leonardo da Vinci’s work, it is considered to have been formulated in 1991 when the US Air Force Ofﬁce of Scientiﬁc Research convened a group of researchers to consider the way in which nature produces and processes unique materials. Thus the original motivation was to achieve inspiration from natural materials and processes as a source of potential innovations in materials design that might be turned into practical applications. The ﬁeld is also known by the term, bionics, as the copying of natural designs. The reference to bionics is also attributed to the US Air Force, but dated by Julian Vincent to the 1950’s. Despite the fact that the evolutionary time-frame of millions of years is of a completely different range of scales from that of contemporary engineering, product design, materials design and architecture, it was considered that the design objectives of these ﬁelds were often similar to those which underlies the evolutionary processes of nature. Among these are functionality, optimization, energy efﬁciency and costeffectiveness. We now can study how nature has optimized the architecture of materials over the long
human species was at stake (Anker 2006). 2.7 Bakelite is an early plastic; a thermosetting phenol formaldehyde resin, formed from an elimination reaction of phenol with formaldehyde, usually with a wood ﬂour ﬁller. It was developed in 19071909 by Belgian chemist Dr. Leo Baekeland.

period of natural evolution. All of these factors are common to contemporary design and engineering ﬁelds. In studying how nature achieves optimization we concentrate on materials, structural properties, mechanical properties, functional integration, sensing and control systems, and other aspects of design that have general relevance for contemporary inventions and solutions. In nature there is little emphasis on esoteric, or “expensive” materials. There are few chemical substances used in animal life, and they are generally constructed using relatively low-performance materials. Success from a design point of view depends not on what they are made of, but rather in how they are made. Structure rather than energy, is the general design principle of nature. It has been said that in nature, ‘shape is cheaper than material’, therefore we have much to learn from nature regarding effective and innovative approaches to the design parameters described above. One of the classic studies which may be considered as among the foundations of the ﬁeld is the work of D’Arcy Thompson, the Scottish naturalist and mathematician, who published the results of his research on natural forms in the inﬂuential work, On Growth and Form of 1917. Here, for one of the ﬁrst occasions in human history, living things are treated as examples of the solution of engineering problems (Thompson 1942). 2.4.3 Biogenesis: Towards Natural Design

In this thesis we consider new approaches to form-generation inspired by nature from a materials perspective. The ﬁrst serious engineering approach to the subject was made by A. G. M. Michell around 1900 in a publication entitled The limits of economy of material in frame-structures (Michell 1904). After that, On Growth and Form was the ﬁrst general account of the inﬂuence of structural requirements on the shapes of plants and animals (Thompson 1942). Other designers and engineers have further developed the fascination with biology and living nature in the context of form-ﬁnding. Among them were Frei Otto and his group at the Institute for Lightweight Structures at the University of Stuttgart during the 1970’s. In a series of publications from that period, speciﬁcally IL-6 which marks the tenth year anniversary of the institute, Otto delivers an honest declaration about such associations and the productivity which they inspire: “Every material object has the ability of conveying forces. We are studying the capability to convey forces independent of form, material, and type of load... in all objects of organic and inorganic matter” (Otto, Trostel et al. 1973, p.5). In this chapter we review structure-mechanical relations at various hierarchical levels of organization, highlighting wherever possible meaningful avenues in the generation and structuring of synthetic form. 2.5 Nature’s Design Strategy: Structural Heterogeneity through Material Distribution

When compared to manmade fabricated materials, many natural materials, particularly in the plant kingdom, mechanically outperform some of the most common materials used by engineers and architects. Woods have strength per unit weight comparable with that of the strongest steels); shell, bone, and antler have toughness an order of magnitude greater than engineering ceramics; and mature bamboo stalks have slenderness ratios which are remarkable even by the standards of modern engineering (Ashby 1995). Yet Nature’s materials are less than half as dense as many of these artiﬁcial materials and are characterized by very low weight and are functional for the plant to sustain2.8 (Niklas 1992). What are the attributes that make natural materials so effective? In his Plant Biomechanics: An Engineering Approach to Plant Form and Function, Niklas determines that organisms live by the laws of physics and chemistry and as
2.8 Since vertical construction carries with it the design constraint of self-loading, in addition to being strong, materials should be light. In fact, for its density, cellulose is the strongest material known (Niklas, 1992).

46 NATURE’S WAY

such they have evolved and adapted to mechanical forces in a manner consistent with the limits set by the mechanical properties of their materials (Niklas 1992). Furthermore, in the plant world particularly it is often the case that material properties inﬂuence the plant’s mechanical behavior2.9 . Niklas demonstrates that the nutshell of the macadamia is as hard as annealed, commercial grade aluminum, resists twice the force necessary to fracture metals of various types, and is stronger than silicate glasses, concrete, porcelain, and domestic brick. Biological materials are indeed very versatile: they can change their material properties to ﬁt the age or the function of their immediate physiological condition2.10 . Hence the mechanical behavior of any single biological material is deﬁned by multiple properties, not all of which can be maximized. Each material is used according to its particular qualities and the types and magnitudes of the mechanical forces it must sustain. In The Mechanical Properties of Natural Materials, Gibson explores various classes of natural materials as she examines the relation between their composite and cellular microstructures and their exceptionally high values of mechanical performance (Gibson 1995). The function of these natural materials exploits their exceptional structural properties: woods and palms resist bending and buckling, silk stores elastic strain energy, muscle stores and releases elastic strain energy during locomotion, and so on. Such relations have signiﬁcant implications for the design of mechanically efﬁcient engineering materials: when considering beams and plates of a given stiffness or strength, or columns of a given buckling resistance, woods, palms and bamboo are among the most efﬁcient materials available (Gibson 1995). Gibson reviews four classes of natural materials: woods, palm and bamboo, stems and quills. The results of the analyses suggest novel microstructures for mechanically efﬁcient engineering materials for bending stiffness and elastic buckling resistance achieved by optimizing micro-structural organization to ﬁt performance requirements such that the cellular structure can enhance performance for loading parallel to the grain (Gibson 1995). Common to all these examples are the exceptional properties of natural materials arising mainly through novel microstructures for efﬁcient engineering materials (Figure 2.6, 2.7). Nature’s building blocks are therefore not as unique as their structuring in that it is not so much the material properties of the components as their arrangement within the natural composites which give rise to such a vast range of properties. Thus we may postulate that Material Structure is an important design property of natural design as well as a signiﬁcant body of design knowledge. 2.6 2.6.1 Case Study 1 (Cellular Solids): Structural Heterogeneity in Bones Macro (System) Scale: The Forces of Human Locomotion

In an inspiring essay, Benno Kummer discusses the work of the anatomist Von Meyer and the technician Culmann to comprehend bone matter as a system incorporating material and morphology as they are informed by structural performance (Otto, Herzog et al. 1990). The material, structure, and form of bone are all interrelated in its formation and behavior. Matter is distributed to ﬁt stress paths in micro and macro scale such that the structural characteristics follow the behavior of the elements and ﬁt their properties. The basic building block of the bone family of materials is the mineralized collagen ﬁbril. It is composed of the ﬁbrous protein collagen in a structural form that is also present in skin, tendon, and a variety of
Given that the plant world is devoid of nervous systems, observations and examinations carried out regarding the relation between material properties and mechanical function are easily established. 2.10 The responsiveness of plants to their immediate mechanical environment was recognized by botanists as early as the midnineteenth century when it was ﬁrst discovered that young plant cell walls are ductile, while older cell walls tend to be much more elastic and resilient (Niklas, 1992).
2.9

Case Study 1 (Cellular Solids): Structural Heterogeneity in Bones 47

other soft tissues. The collagen constitutes the main component of a three-dimensional matrix into which, and in some cases onto which, the mineral forms (Weiner and Wagner 1998). The manner in which the building blocks are organized into higher order structures can also vary, and in fact, this is the basis for differentiating between the members of the bone family of biological materials. Furthermore, some such materials are composed of two or three different organizational structures such that the whole structure may be folded into even larger superstructures. The range of their orders and properties reﬂects many different variables: the diversity in structures, the orientation of the specimens, the variations in mineralization extent and porosity, the precise locations of the specimens, and so on. Thus the structures of these materials must be understood both in terms of the differences between family members, and most importantly according to hierarchical levels of organization (Weiner and Wagner 1998). Understanding structure-function relations in these materials is therefore a challenge. The understanding of this subject requires sorting out the bulk mechanical behavior in terms of the contributions of the sub-structures at each hierarchical level. However, since many of these materials change their structure in time, and in turn affect the mechanical properties of the tissue2.11 . Furthermore, specialized bone cells actively remove older bone and replace it with younger bone, which may even have a slightly different structure such that it is presumably optimized to function in the prevailing stress ﬁeld at the time of its formation Weiner, S. and H. Wagner (1998). “The material bone: structure-mechanical function relations.” This would still not be a valid analysis. Weiner and Wagner have chosen to organize their review according to the hierarchical levels of organization (Figure 2.8). They discuss 5 of the 7 hierarchical levels, which range in scale from nanometers to millimeters, in terms of their structures and mechanical properties (Weiner and Addadi 1997; Weiner and Wagner 1998).

2.6.3

The structure of skeletal elements is not the only feature which is adapted to the type of mechanical strain. This applies to the same extent for the density distribution of the bony material providing the mechanical strength. Today it is generally accepted that the density and anisotropy of cancellous bone depends on the magnitude and direction of the loads it experiences (Gibson 1984; Ashby 1995; Gibson and Ashby 1997). Kummer and his fellow scientists at the institute devised graphical techniques, such as the Material Mountain Ranges (Figure 2.9), to quantify material distribution of bony matter as it relates to the distribution of strain, and assisted in the understanding that both the structure and the distribution of material in bone is adapted to the type and magnitude of mechanical strain. Cancellous bone has a cellular structure, and is considered to incorporate similar mechanical properties and structural behavior characteristic of the family of cellular solids (Gibson 1984; Ashby 1995; Gibson and Ashby 1997). Furthermore, it is probably one of the more classical examples for a system which organizes matter consistent with stress patterns across scales of both material and structure, a distinction that is at times vague and difﬁcult to make.
Some of these changes are in part thermodynamically driven, such as the increase in the sizes of the crystals, and some are also biologically mediated, such as the determination of the average proportions of collagen, mineral, and water in a given material.

Case Study 2 (Fiber Structures): Structural Heterogeneity in Trees

I have spent many hours gazing at trees. Beyond their extraordinary beauty, trees are the perfect example of systems which have been shaped by the forces of nature and as such, they represent Nature’s strategies in regards to the growth, generation, adaptation and preservation of form. Natural systems are shaped by, and exposed to the elements surrounding them. The range of loads to which a tree is exposed is vast and it includes forces of various magnitudes and directions, bending moments, torsional moments, and thermal stresses amongst others. If the tree is to resist the loads exerted upon it, these loads must be countered by a support applying equally large, but opposed, reaction loads against it. In the engineering disciplines it is often the case that such force-form relations are simpliﬁed and abstracted as post beam models in order to predict physical deformation. However, Nature’s strategies must not be merely reduced to geometrical abstraction, for in Nature the distribution of material substance relative to its guiding and shaping forces is as signiﬁcant to the tree’s structural stability as is its form itself. All in all, the case of the tree provides for a good starting point by which to understand the forces of Nature. 2.7.1 2.7.1.1 Macro (System) Scale: The Forces of Nature Axial Forces

Axial forces are the most basic example. The mass of a tree’s branches exerts (by its very own weight) an axial force on its trunk, thus causing compressive stress. The branches cause an elastic compression of the trunk in the axial direction resulting in a spatially uniform distribution of compressive stresses (Mattheck 1998). The soil below the tree’s trunk must therefore exert an equally great but opposite force in order to avoid the hypothetical condition in which the post sinks into the soil. As a reaction, axial tensile forces would cause tensile stresses in the post. The situation is rather more complicated with eccentric loading. 2.7.1.2 Eccentric Loading

When dissecting a trunk horizontally, it is rather easy to trace the relative location of branches by establishing areas in the section more or less denser with tissue. In the case of eccentric loading, a uniform bending moment may be acting downwards in the entire trunk, compensated by the ground via the roots. Naturally, the bending moment in the side branch will cause much higher bending stresses than in the trunk. In this case, it may become quite apparent that in the central axis within the trunk and the branch neither tensile nor compressive stresses are present. Despite not being fully loaded, this zone within the tree constrains wood capable of bearing load. Furthermore, it is otherwise quite ineffective with regards to bending and thus rather wasteful from a materials perspective. Nature tolerates this deﬁciency in a tree motionless and anchored in the soil. However in a mobile mammal one ﬁnds various bones that are hollow in the zones where ﬁbers sustain neutral bending. In the animal kingdom it is thus the case that no material is placed where there is nothing to carry: in such regions bones are shaped simply as hollow tubes. 2.7.1.3 Lateral Loading

The tree arranges its material sensibly within the narrower limits of its possibilities: trees loaded laterally on one side by wind become elliptical in the wind direction. Thus, if the tree now deposits all its

Case Study 2 (Fiber Structures): Structural Heterogeneity in Trees 49

building materials in the zone of highest bending stress (tension side and compression side) by forming particularly wide annual rings there, this buildup goes into the third power of the large axis (the longitudinal axis describing the trunk), while a widening in the direction of the small axis is only linear. The tree thus forms a non-circular cross-section which is stiffest against the prevailing bending load, and is characterized by smaller stresses than a uniformly circular cross-section with an identical external bending moment. Root cross-sections may even assume nearly the shape of an I-beam, in which hardly any wood forms in the zone of neutral bending. Here the component is forced into an optimization of shape (Mattheck 1998). 2.7.1.4 Composite Loading

Besides tensile and compressive stresses resulting from axial tension or compression and the bending stresses (transition from tensile to compressive stresses with a deﬁned spatial, usually linear, distribution) there are also the shear stresses. These are stresses acting tangentially in the shear-loaded plane, and prevent the bodies separated by it from sliding on each other. They are therefore qualitatively very different from the tension and bending stresses acting perpendicularly to a given reference plane. The torsion load causes, for example, a shear stress distribution in the cross-sectional plane of the twisted cylinder illustrated, which increases linearly from the center. In our tree, a one-sided crown shape, with one branch extending far towards the light, could lead to a twisting of the trunk under wind pressure and cause the same shear stresses in the trunk. Each instance of loading is made up of a large composition of loading cases. Naturally, loading conditions are usually multi-axial and different stresses act in different directions. 2.7.2 2.7.2.1 Meso (Structure) Scale: Shape Adaptation in Fibrous Systems Tension and Compression Wood

Reaction wood, also known by its scientiﬁc term gravitropism, is abnormal wood found in the trunks and branches of leaning trees resulting in abnormal rings wider on one side than the other. It is formed by the tree’s response to directional stress and its attempt to counteract it. In hardwoods, reaction wood is also known as tension wood as it forms on the upper side of the lean. In softwoods, reaction wood is known as compression wood forms on the lower side of the leaning tree (Figure 2.10). Although compression wood has a higher than-normal density, it is weak in some critical strength properties. The most serious drawback of compression wood is its abnormal drying behavior. When normal wood in the form of lumber dries, it shrinks in thickness and width (by predictable amounts). It shrinks very little (practically negligible) in length. Compression wood, however, shrinks in length by more than 10 times that of normal wood. This causes bowing and twisting of certain pieces of lumber. 2.7.2.2 Material Distribution through Optimization

Reaction wood is an interesting case of material formation informed by mechanical environmental stimuli that are external to the tree’s genotype. In this sense, any material optimization processes occurring to counteract directional stress are relative to the tree’s particular loading case. The tree’s capacity to adapt itself to these external conditions is essential under conditions of uncertainty as far as future loading cases are considered. Material optimization occurs as ﬁber structures within the woody tissue compute stimuli of morphomechanical nature and translate it into a process known as transduction, characterized by the movement

50 NATURE’S WAY

of starch grains within the plant cell corresponding to the direction and magnitude of the load. A signaling regulation mechanism follows preceding the mechanical response. Shape adaptation is naturally dependant on the offset angle from the vertical axis as ﬁber reorientation emerges in time. 2.7.2.3 Hierarchical Levels of Shape Adaptation

The basic mechanism for shape-change in plants is based on the restructuring of ﬁber structures in multiple scales. Shape adaptation, characterized by incremental changes in curvature, occurs as nonsymmetric tree laminates respond to external load forming compression and tension wood in the top and bottom areas of the tissue respectively. Local structural changes thus affect global curvature (Figure 2.11, 2.12). Three hierarchical levels of shape adaptation may be observed as mechanical reorientation occurs on the cell walls (local level), the tissue (regional level) and the trunk (global level). In this case, geometrical manipulation is dependent on growth, deposition and reorientation of ﬁber structures. 2.7.3 Micro (Material) Scale

Tracheids in softwoods and ﬁbers in hardwoods, for instance, provide the mechanical support for the tree. Gibson has idealized the cellular structure by modeling only the tracheids, or ﬁbers, as a honeycomb. The models suggest the complexity of ﬁber orientation as larger numbers of ﬁbers orient themselves more nearly, parallel to the axis of the cell than normal to it (Gibson 1995). Given the layup, the Young’s modulus for the cell wall can be calculated from composite theory. Another striking feature illustrated by Gibson are the relatively dense, ﬁber-like vascular bundles distributed throughout a “matrix” of parenchyma cells that make up the bulk of most non-woody structures. Longitudinal sections reveal ﬁber alignment relative to mechanical function. Some tissues on the other hand, such as palm stems have a non-uniform radial distribution of vascular bundles, with more bundles of larger diameter at the periphery than at the center. Unlike wood, palm lacks a cambium through which radial growth can occur to provide support with increasing height. Instead, palm stems rely largely on increasing the thickness and degree of ligniﬁcations of older cell walls leading to radial and longitudinal gradients in tissue density. The stem of bamboo has a radially varying volume fraction of “ﬁbers”, increasing its ﬂexural rigidity (Gibson 1995). Plant stems resist both axial load (from their own mass) and bending moment (from wind loads): structurally, they act as beam-columns. Plant stems are axissymmetric: their cylindrical tubes are able to resist wind blowing form any direction equally. Local buckling is accounted for by internal pressurization of the stem and support of a dense stiff outer shell by an elastic foundation of foam-like material (Gibson 1995). More speciﬁcally, wood consists of cellulose ﬁbers in a lignin, hemicellulose matrix, shaped to hollow prismatic cells. Skin, tendon and cartilage are all largely collagenous composites: in skin, the collagen is sandwiched between a basement membrane and an overlying keratinized epidermis; in tendon, the collagen ﬁbers are aligned to form rope-like structures which make up most of the volume; and in cartilage, the collagen ﬁbers are in a proteoglycan matrix with a small volume fraction of elastin ﬁbers. Hair, nail, horn, wool, reptilian scales and hooves are made of keratin while insect cuticle is largely chitin. Bone, shell and antler are composites of calcite, hydroxyapatite or aragonite platelets dispersed in a helical matrix of collagen (Vogel 2003).

2.8

The Advantages of Material Distribution over Material Assembly

Fibers can be seen everywhere in Nature, and across multiple scales. Like engineering materials, natural materials can also be grouped into classes the common denominator of which is that all natural materials are made of ﬁbers. They include: (1) Natural ceramic and ceramic composites include bone, shell, coral, antler, enamel and dentine. All are made up of ceramic particles such as hydroxyapatite, calcite or aragonite in a matrix of collagen; (2) Natural polymers and polymer composites include cellulose, chitin, silk, cuticle, collagen, keratin and tendon; (3) Natural elastomers such as skin, muscle, cartilage, artery, abduction, resilin, and elastin; (4) Natural cellular materials such as wood, cancellous bone, palm and cork all have low densities because of the high volume fractions of voids they contain. They are almost always anisotropic because of the shape and orientation of the cells and of the ﬁbers they contain; the prismatic cells of wood, for instance, give a much greater stiffness and strength along the grain than across it. Fibrous composite structures in nature are used mainly for three functions: (1) to introduce and exploit heterogeneity and anisotropy (locally and globally); (2) to modulate the tissue’s physical properties; and, (3) to create functional architectures and shapes through structural hierarchies. All three functions are clearly interrelated. Nature’s capacity to structure its material organizations in a variety of different ways by which to efﬁciently and effectively correspond to multiple functions has various advantages in the natural world. They include (1) anisotropy, (2) heterogeneity and, (3) hierarchical structuring. 2.8.1 Anisotropy

Anisotropy is the property of being directionally dependent. It implies the heterogeneity of physical and mechanical properties relative to their functions. Anisotropy can be deﬁned as a difference, when measured along different axes, in a material’s physical property (absorbance, refractive index, density, etc.) Wood, as previously demonstrated, is a naturally anisotropic material. Its properties vary widely when measured with the growth grain or against it. For example, wood’s strength and hardness will be different for the same sample if measured in differing orientation. The advantage in controlling the directionality of physical and mechanical properties results in highly efﬁcient structures and forms customized to their environment and tailored to support the range of constraints introduced to them by their immediate environment. 2.8.2 Heterogeneity

Heterogeneity allows for the generation of position-dependent material properties. It is here considered as higher-level anisotropies accounting for non-homogeneous distribution of ﬁbers with multiple directions (Figures 2.13, 2.14). 2.8.3 Hierarchical Structuring

The emergence of hierarchical structures in natural tissues and specimens is promoted by anisotropic material structuring resulting in heterogeneous organizations that, when superimposed, enhance the mechanical performance of the substrate. Bottom-up assemblies of structures and interfaces appear as multiple material organizations form super-structures in meso-, and macro-scales.

Natural Dichotomies on the Way to Design by Material Distribution

The distinction between materials and structures in the context of design is not a trivial one. It exists as a ﬁgure of measure related to scales of function and behavior. When we give scale to an object it acquires new meaning and gives meaning back to its environment. In this sense, scale allows us to go beyond formal representations which remain otherwise abstract in category: With scale comes a commitment to physics. In his seminal essay On Magnitude, D’Arcy Thompson argues that any conception of form must be referred to in terms of magnitude and direction, “for the effect of scale depends not on a thing in itself but in relation to its whole environment or milieu” (Thompson 1952). Hence any manifestation of form must be examined not as mere representation but rather (and quite literally) as an entity embedded within its surroundings - whether physical or programmatic. Since we will be dealing with design artifacts which are physical in nature, the difference between “material” and “structure” is fundamental to the logic of material organization that is informed by performance. In dealing with biology from an engineering point of view, Julian Vincent states that wood or leaf have obvious “structure” yet are mostly treated as materials. The resolution to this problem, according to Vincent, generally lies in behavior2.12 : when dealing with a material, then it will have the same stiffness in tension, bending and compression in all directions. If it doesn’t it is structure we’re dealing with the stiffness which is being measured is not a material parameter (Vincent 1982). Materials are typically classiﬁed by charted properties such as strength, density, toughness, elongation, electrical resistively and energy content whereas structures are typically classiﬁed by behavior (Gordon 1976). For instance some structures are good for compressive loads (shells, frame structures) whereas others are good for tension loads (membranes, cable structures, etc.). 2.9.1 The Dichotomy between Shape and Size

Shape and size are of (traditional) concerns to the comparative and functional morphologist since they intrinsically deﬁne material form resulting from self-loading. The relation between shape and size is such that the size of an organism dictates the weight that must be sustained, while the shape of the organism deﬁnes the cross-sectional areas through which weight operates. Similarly, the spatial distribution of materials within an object which translates into the anatomy of a biological structure, deﬁnes the local strains resulting from a given load. Shape and size thus inﬂuence the relative magnitudes of stresses that develop within structural support members such as plant stems and tubular leaves. The importance of shape and size to biomechanics is self-evident when we consider engineering parameters called moments of area, which are mathematical descriptions of the spatial distribution of material within an object (Niklas 1992). Furthermore, of the characteristics of organisms, only that of shape approaches size in terms of its variability; and shape proves far harder to reduce to one or a few numerical speciﬁcations. It has been a subliminal presence so far much avoided! Most of the slop in the data behind the scaling exponents comes probably from shape variability. How to deal with shape in our search for general rules of biological organization and operation? Some shape descriptions that have proven useful are: center of gravity (or, center of mass), moments of area, center of buoyancy (center of volume), fractal dimension, ﬂatness index.

There are also exceptions: single crystals can be anisotropic.

Natural Dichotomies on the Way to Design by Material Distribution 53

2.9.2

The Dichotomy between Structure and Material

Given that cost-effective and durable structures are the result of constraint negotiations carried over millennia, biological materials do not typically distinguish between material and structure (Rogers 1993). Furthermore, in Nature, the distinction between intelligent material systems and intelligent structures is basically irrelevant. Indeed, it may only be applied superﬁcially in terms of the scale of a material’s microstructure which governs its behavior, regardless of its size (Rogers 1993). However, such distinction between structure and material has been repeatedly emphasized because the mechanical behavior of a structure can be understood only when its geometry and the material properties of its constituent solids or ﬂuids are considered together. For instance, the geometry of the cell wall infrastructure within a plant tissue may in some cases supersede in importance the material properties of the infrastructure. Thus we can never disassociate the mechanical behavior of a tissue from it anatomical conﬁguration (Niklas 1992). The term bone refers to a family of materials, all of which are built up of mineralized collagen ﬁbrils. They have highly complex structures, described in terms of up to 7 hierarchical levels of organization. These materials have evolved to fulﬁll a variety of mechanical functions, for which the structures are presumably ﬁne-tuned. Matching structure to function is a challenge (Weiner and Wagner 1998). 2.9.3 The Dichotomy between Size and Scale

Organisms occupy an extensive size range in Nature of about a hundred million fold2.13 : from the tiniest bacteria of about 0.3 micrometers long (a hundred thousandth of an inch) to whales of about 30 meters (110 feet) long. Vogel determines that when determining how size affects biological design, nothing is more signiﬁcant than the relationship between surface area and volume (Vogel 2003). This is mainly due to the fact that any contact between an organism and its surroundings are a function of its surface, while its internal processes and structure depend predominantly on its volume2.14 . However, in Nature, surface area and volume do not maintain a simple proportionality. In other words, one cannot simultaneously double both the surface area and the volume of a body without changing its shape2.15 (Vogel 2003). In other words, an organism’s shape determines the environmentally and functionally signiﬁcant ratio between surface areas to volume. Operational scales in biological systems have evolved to match natural scales and hierarchies of scales are often repeated in Nature. In a variety of mature adult lamellar bone2.16 for instance, the interconnected bars known as trabeculae, and plates of bony tissue, are resized and reshaped by osteoclasts (bone-destroying cells) and osteoblasts (bone-forming cells). At the micrometer scale, there is a ‘plywood’ structure of layers (lamellae) of about 3 m bundles of collagen ﬁbers. Bone salt crystals (impure carbonate apatite) ﬁll much of the water space in the collagenous matrix as they form the bone’s hierarchical structures. Similarly, when examined from the naked eye to the atomic force microscope, a piece of steel or ceramic will show a hierarchy of natural scales. In order of increasing magniﬁcation they include the sensed surface roughness, the observed grain structures with dislocations and inclusions of other phases, the space-charge regions or atmospheres of impurities around dislocations or segregated to interfaces, and, ﬁnally, atomic structures come into view. Mesoscopic features are those with characteristic scales between the atomic and macroscopic, and are crucial in how materials perform (Stoneham
2.13 The indicated range is equivalent to 8 orders of magnitude. When compared to the building industry one might consider a range equal to only 3 orders of magnitude from sand grain to brick. 2.14 This is mostly true for buildings too. 2.15 Here it is relevant to note that surfaces are proportional to the square of lengths; volumes are proportional to the cubes of lengths. 2.16 Also known as spongy (cancellous or trabeculae) bone.

and Harding 2009). This idea of an appropriate scale for a given system and property emerges repeatedly in natural systems. Furthermore, there might be several such scales, depending on the property. For a tree trunk, the appropriate scale for strength differs from the appropriate scale for water transport. For photochromic sunglasses, the scale for metal colloids contributing to darkening is much less than that for mechanical robustness. Identifying the right operational scales is a ﬁrst step on the way to optimizing mesostructures by guiding a system to adopt the right scale. 2.10 Summary

Biological materials display exquisite hierarchical structural control designed for speciﬁc loading conditions, including the recurrent use of fundamental constituents, controlled crystallography, anisotropies and/or isotropy, orientation of structural elements, gradients, durable mechanically interlocking interfaces between dissimilar materials (compliant/ductile and rigid/hard), complex shapes/geometries, porosity, etc. (Vincent 1982; Wainwright 1982; Weiner and Addadi 1997; Weiner and Wagner 1998; Currey 2005; Ortiz and Boyce 2008) The fundamental constituents of biological materials typically exhibit weak macro-scale mechanical properties (brittle biological ceramics and compliant macromolecules), and yet, they are able to achieve orders-of-magnitude increases in strength and toughness; this “mechanical property ampliﬁcation” occurs in a non-additive manner that goes beyond the simple composite rule of mixture formulations (Wegst and Ashby 2004; Ortiz and Boyce 2008. In this chapter I have chosen to focus on the structure-property relationships of co-continuous meso-scale composite microstructures inspired from designs observed in biology. We have seen that many natural systems assemble multiple layers of different porous microstructures together as they form higher order geometrical shapes culminating in macro-scale hierarchical designs that work together with the inherent material properties to achieve the required biomechanical function. In particular, we have focused on the strategies devised by Nature to promote heterogeneity and distribution at the material level (through anisotropy, heterogeneity and hierarchies), at the structure level (through shape adaptation along with dimensional and topological changes) and ﬁnally, at the system level (through emergent behavior and adaptation). We have also learned that such distinguishing traits between “material” and “structure” are at times quite elusive. The design implications of the structuring of difference, or structural heterogeneity achieved through the informed distribution of ﬁbers, holds signiﬁcant implications from a design standpoint. Fiber structure orientation allows for an almost unlimited design space in terms of geometrical and topological variation, it promotes high levels of functional integration through the assignment of graduated properties, it supports the matching between material property distribution and continuous load paths, it allows the designer to consider the possibility of adaptive response, along with potential unlimited explorations of optimization strategies for robustness and a relatively easy integration of sensing functions. As we have seen in previous examples as well as the detailed case studies into bones and trees, ﬁbers represent physical line elements providing paths for transmitting, transferring and diffusing mechanical and chemical information into structures. Groups of ﬁbres can be organised in one-, two-, and threedimensions to create physical equivalents of lines, surfaces and solids such as those obtainable from textile technologies (which preserve ﬁbre mobility) or composite technologies (where the ﬁbrous networks are rigidiﬁed by bonding together ﬁber bundles). As we move from the world of natural materials to artiﬁcial man-made materials in search for novel formmaking strategies that comply with those of sustainable design, Nature’s way will remain a revealing source of inspiration. Through the discussion in the following chapter of machine controlled braiding,

ﬁlament winding, knitting, bending, twisting and nano-ﬁber production along with various other exciting nature-inspired design techniques, we will discover just how quickly the design world is catching up, and what major challenges remain unresolved, on the way to a more Natural Design.

This condition is particularly evident in the plant kingdom where ﬁber structures are physically structured and spatially organized to combine structural functions (such as stability) with environmental functions (such as water transfer and heat absorption).

3.1

Shape over Matter: The Crisis of Form

As in Nature, when creation begins with matter, morphogenesis, or the generation of form, is a process engendered by the physical forces of Nature. Similarly, in the framework of this thesis, Material is not considered as a subordinate attribute of form, but rather as its progenitor. Such is the story of form told from the point of view of matter, and it begins, unsurprisingly, with form’s crisis. To paraphrase Darwin: there is more to the origin of form than the preservation of favorite expressions in the struggle for style. By way of practice we are educated to apply matter opportunistically to any given form. This inherent design methodology implicitly assumes the predominance of shape over matter in processes of form-generation. However, when the order is inverted, we ﬁnd that starting with matter is not as straightforward a process as we might anticipate. Shape, it appears, (still) rules over matter. 3.1.1 Form First, Structure First, Material First: the Designer’s Causality Dilemma

It is important to stress that despite momentous progress in material science, engineering and construction, material has remained inferior to shape across most scales and disciplines of design. Indeed, most literature in the realm of materials in architectural design has centered on questions relating to material selection rather than questions relating to material generation. Consequently, materials are traditionally pre-deﬁned and classiﬁed as property pools in the process of design materialization. Until recently, the function of materials in design processes thus appears to be considered and persistently treated as secondary to form itself. This condition has indeed been ampliﬁed by the construction industry and digital fabrication processes which have exacerbated the tendency of the designer to materialize form by liberally accessing materials as a library of open and eclectic potential. However, this is anything but a new

70 THE NEW MATERIALITY

phenomenon. A brief historical review of early forms of craft as well as some of the most innovative, au courant, developments in material science and engineering, illuminates, yet again, the role of material as the substance of form, rather than form’s progenitor. In Nature’s Way we have demonstrated an alternative path to the generation of form whereby the interaction between material properties and their environment is (naturally) prioritized and thus precedes and propagates the resulting shapes. Material behavior in Nature appears to be a prerequisite for the emergence of form, and yet in design, shape eternally comes ﬁrst. Given our methods and technologies for design production, this condition is anything but coincidental. The tools that architects and designers use today in the processes of form representation and generation assume geometric form’s instrumental superiority. In design, the process appears as simple and as straightforward as that: imagine, draw, apply and analyze; construction follows. Invert this process, and you will, again, arrive at Nature’s Way. 3.1.2 Origins of a New Materiality in Design

To claim that the prioritizing of material in design is a recent discovery would be profoundly inaccurate. The history of material science and engineering is a testament to cultural production and a protocol of the way in which humans have interacted with their environment in their search for shelter, habitation and well-being (Ashby 1995). The signiﬁcance of materials in the development of early civilizations is attested to by the way in which archaeology has divided technological progress into eras deﬁned by materials endemic to them: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. Today’s epoch may be described as the Materials Age, as a result of new developments in materials and technologies which have dramatically altered the way in which we make, build and live (Ashby 1995). Indeed, one of the most thrilling precedents in the design of materials to date is the evolution of composites in all classes and scales. Composites are a central chapter in the history of twentieth century technology as demonstrated in Antonelli’s “Mutant Materials” exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art more than a decade ago (Antonelli 1995). Yet even with the testament of such emerging tendencies of a design culture of the material, the problem of material’s inferiority complex to shape still lingers as a design cultural phenomenon characteristic of the theory and practice of modern design. The literature concerning material in design is vast, though for the design researcher, it is also overwhelmingly fragmented. A survey of this open-ended ﬁeld indicates the wide array of research areas representing, exploring, classifying and researching the topic. There are many scientiﬁc and design views of what may constitute the physical and behavioral characteristics of materials, and even more interpretations for each view. However, most importantly, each of these views may be useful to a particular construct of a given ﬁeld and for a given application (Addington and Schodek 2005). The breadth of interest and activity around new and innovative materials and material technologies today is one of the dominant inﬂuences upon contemporary architectural and industrial design. Kwinter has referred to material as “the new space” (Kwinter 2001). This tendency is so prominent, in fact, that the drive for material innovation in recent years has been broadly absorbed into the design and research of mainstream practice (Balmond, Smith et al. 2002; Addington and Schodek 2005). The design professions as a whole have experienced the renaissance in materials over the last few years. In addition to key publications and relevant excerpts from journal articles, leading exhibitions and publications highlight the role of materials in design. In particular, design interest and experimentation with composites and textile-like material design (McQuaid and Beesley 2005; Ritter 2007) has been abundant and exposed the need to consolidate our methods and our practices. This new materialism appears to have a diverse and complex inﬂuence upon contemporary design. Historically there are two distinct ways of inﬂuencing design. The ﬁrst quickly absorbed material as a stylistic and formal phenomenon, while the second is more profound in exploring the complex interrela-

Shape over Matter: The Crisis of Form 71

tions between science, technology and design that have only begun to emerge (Antonelli 1995; Antonelli 2008). The literature on the topic of smart, or intelligent, materials, and material systems is vast and has accumulated over the last decade to include designations as varied as the disciplinary contexts in which they originated (Gordon 1976; Addington and Schodek 2005; McQuaid and Beesley 2005; McQuaid, Beesley et al. 2005; Braddock Clarke and OMahoney 2007; Ritter 2007). However, there exist two prevalent paradigms which may be used to classify most such designations (Rogers 1993). The ﬁrst definition is based upon a technological paradigm and relates to the integration of actuators, sensors, and controls embedded within a material, or structural component. Such a deﬁnition speciﬁes the elements comprising the material but avoids completely addressing its utility and the means by which it has been fabricated and assembled. The second deﬁnition is based upon a science paradigm and it attempts to relate predominantly to the material’s micro-structure as a system capable of informing its functionality. Related sets of deﬁnitions in this paradigm include both the material’s structural functionality its ability to reduce mass and adapt to changing energetic constraints, and the way in which it has been fabricated. A detailed inspection of the relevant literary sources quickly communicates the well-known mentality in architectural-design whereby materials are typically selected, not designed. Several material selection routines and ways of classifying them have evolved over the years by and for different disciplines. The choice of material cannot be made independently from the choice of process by which the material is formed, joined, ﬁnished, and otherwise treated (Ashby 1995; Ashby 2005). Similarly, the revival of material consciousness in design is most likely associated with the fast rate at which fabrication technologies are entering contemporary discourse. As such tools develop, principles of material science and technology merge with other specialties such as engineering, chemistry, biotechnology, and information science (McQuaid and Beesley 2005). This interdisciplinary state of design knowledge is rapidly ﬁnding its way where the most pressing issues and questions concerning the generation of form arise. This chapter focuses on the latter class of materials and explores the material’s structure and behavior as deﬁned by its properties devoid of the introduction of electronics. The aim is to explore the potential to reorganize matter from a purely physical perspective. Furthermore, it provides a critical review based on a survey of the state-of-the-art of materials in design. It will start by questioning material’s role as shape ﬁller, and point towards a potential shift in design process and thinking. It will highlight the roles materials currently possess as secondary to the generation of form itself, and in most cases tertiary to form’s rationalization as structural entity by the engineer. On the basis of this introduction it will raise key research issues and will propose a novel deﬁnition of new materiality as a non-hierarchical association between form, structure and material. 3.2 3.2.1 The Component Syndrome: Expressions of a Design Cultural Crisis Form as Iconic Shape

Architecturally speaking, when we think of “form” we think of the shape of a thing and how it might be described in terms of its geometry. For thousands of years, the largest structures on earth were the pyramids, but rarely does one refer to the distribution of load when describing the shape of a monumental tetrahedron. The nature of this claim remains consistent across the periods from ancient Egypt to Bilbao. Form is a category of description as opposed to a causal condition as it might be described in Nature. Furthermore, it is a well accepted in architectural practice that preconceived spaces of various forms and shapes have been conventionally designated for generic classes of functions. To challenge this classical space-making tradition, architects have recently begun to exploit emergent technologies in the construction industry supported by a body of inventions in processes and materials. And, indeed, the

72 THE NEW MATERIALITY

general prevailing assumption amongst many architects and designers is that all that is imaginable is buildable. We are approaching an era in which this assumption is not too far from the truth. But coupled with it, are many less exciting consequences, particularly when considering the environment. This, the architect’s passionate search for form, has prioritized formal expression and consequently deeply victimized environmental sustainability. A materials-based approach to design, potentially replacing this form syndrome with material sensibility, may be of signiﬁcant impact in today’s climate of environmental crisis. 3.2.2 Form as Assembly: Habitat as Machine for Producing Obsolescence

Building by components is everywhere. They are the prevalent means by which to describe and construct form’s physical manifestation. Given that we cannot yet grow a design, as does Nature, we assemble it. Material assemblies have been around for many centuries. It was the industrial revolution however, in the late 18th century that has planted the seeds of componentization as the logic for the mass-produced product. With mass-production came ideas in design that conceived human habitat mechanistically, that is as a living machine. Its advantages were clear and economically viable: all parts could be replicated, replaced and reassembled in adaptation to change. However, this conception carried with it certain serious disadvantages which were soon to damage the natural environment. Material redundancy and waste express only a small segment of what might be considered the condition of industrial pathology. The building industry may still be identiﬁed with the value system projected by the industrial revolution: standardization, homogenization, modularity, redundancy and repeatability. However, most or all of these characteristics of industrialization are antithetical to Nature’s Way. Thus it comes as no surprise that the economy and design culture of obsolescence are in profound contradiction to the contemporary search for a more sustainable design practice. Form driven by the design and control of materials across multiple scales may lead the way to a more environmentally responsible, structurally sound, and no-less formally expressive design approach. 3.3 The Selection Syndrome: Methodological Expressions of a Design Cultural Syndrome

Given material’s typically secondary role in the expression of shape, the consideration of material as “shape ﬁller” comes as no surprise. As such, material is characteristically selected from an array of potential matches between its properties and its hosting form. Ashby claims that the selection of a material and process cannot be separated from the choice of shape (Ashby 1995; Ashby 2005). Such a claim makes reasonable sense considering that each material presents the designer with its own set of properties as well as geometrical and structural constraints. However this logic maintains the continued priority of shape over matter. 3.3.1 Beyond Material as Shape Filler

There exist various ways by which to classify materials. Material science and engineering classiﬁcations typically deal with material composition and properties. Reﬂected in such classiﬁcations are insights that provide a way of describing speciﬁc properties or qualities such as hardness, electrical conductivity, etc. that characterize different materials3.1 . Consequently, while the material scientist is occupied with
The Representative Volume Element (RVE) is one such way of classifying material properties within a singular volume element. This concept is central to the mechanics and physics of random heterogeneous materials with a view to predicting their effective properties. The RVE size is associated with the estimation of the desired overall property of a material relative
3.1

The Selection Syndrome: Methodological Expressions of a Design Cultural Syndrome 73

the relationship between the structure of materials at atomic or molecular scales and their macroscopic properties, the structural engineer engages with material behavior. In selecting the optimal material for a given function, the engineer must weigh categories such as state, structure, processing techniques, environmental conditions, and applications (Addington and Schodek 2005). Michael Ashby’s material selection charts provide the designer and engineer with a highly efﬁcient template of classiﬁcation (Figure 3.1). In his Material Selection in Mechanical Design (Ashby 2005), Ashby introduces a design tool for materials selection in engineering. It provides a highly consistent and systematic compilation of materials, their properties and applications in design. Ashby classiﬁes the family of engineering materials as six families including metals, polymers, elastomers, ceramics, glasses, and hybrids (Ashby 2005). Family members have a number of features in common such as properties, processing routines, and, often, similar applications. The family of hybrids includes combinations of two or more materials in a pre-determined conﬁguration and scale. They include ﬁber and particulate composites, sandwich structures, lattice structures, foams, cables and laminates. Fiber-reinforced composites are of course the most familiar and incredibly desirable for their combination of lightness, stiffness, strength and toughness. Ashby’s material property charts were developed as a response to the designer’s need for an efﬁcient materials selection process based on multiple criteria. Since it is almost always the case that the designer is interested in a combination of properties rather than a singular one, each material is presented as having a set of attributes. In this way, ratios of strength to weight, and weight to stiffness may be considered in plotting one property against another. The resulting charts are useful in that they condense a large body of information into compact and accessible form. They reveal correlations between material properties that aid in checking and estimating data along with a characteristic span of values (Ashby 1995; Ashby 2005). 3.3.2 From Selection to Formation

Materials by themselves, however, require the application of innovative technologies, tools, and techniques that process them into shapes desired to ﬁt their functions. In other words, the way in which a material may be treated, directly affects its performance and its functional traits. The distinction between material and matter carries much relevance in this context, the latter being traditionally associated with the notion of an omnipotent substance that may be made into any desired shape (Smith 1980; Smith 1981). Such “making” or “structuring” of matter, involves a deep understanding of material properties and their capacity for physical manipulation. Recent advancements in material science and engineering have introduced the notion of designing material behavior. The ﬁeld of composite materials, speciﬁcally, the ﬁeld of Material Science has enhanced the designer’s capability to inﬂuence and control material behavior. All industries are equally inspired and affected by this climate while most design ﬁelds are contributing to the pool of exhilarating turnof-the-century products; architecture, building construction, civil engineering, transportation, medicine, agriculture, sports and fashion are all imposing pressing challenges on the state of design in the reinterpretation of the role of materials. This is unquestionably the age of materials. As tools for the generation, production and construction of form turn into integral parts of computational environments for design. Through the concept of material behavior the physical qualities of form itself
to the number of realizations of a given volume V of microstructure that one is able to consider. It is shown to depend on the investigated morphological or physical property, its contrast compared to the materials’ constituents, and their volume fractions. RVE sizes can be found for a range of physical properties including elastic strain energy and thermal conductivity, but also for geometrical properties such as volume faction Gusev, A. (1997). “Representative volume element size for elastic composites: a numerical study.” Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids 45(9): 1449-1459.

74 THE NEW MATERIALITY

is gaining new interpretations. 3.4 3.4.1 Nature’s Way: Environmentally Informed Structural Heterogeneity Anisotropy: Nature’s Difference Engine

Traditionally, we tend to classify materials, along with their various properties, either as structural or as functional (Stoneham and Harding 2003). Structural materials are mainly exploited for their mechanical properties, while functional materials have some other purpose, in relation to electrical, thermal, optical properties, or combinations of them. In Nature, however, it is often quite challenging to distinguish between structural and functional materials as most biological materials such as wood can be both structural (supporting the branches of a tree) and functional (pumping water up to the leaves), with different scales for these different roles. Nature achieves such integration by varying the material’s properties and introducing in it directional (structural) changes relative to their functions. This ability is termed anisotropy and has been brieﬂy described in the previous chapter. Generally speaking, anisotropy is deﬁned as directional dependency. It is expressed as a given difference in a material’s physical property (absorbance, refractive index, etc) when measured along different axes (Bar-Cohen 2006). Wood for instance, is a naturally anisotropic material. Its physical properties vary widely when measured along the growth grain or against it (in other words, there is a dependence of the Young’s modulus on the direction of load. This is also the reason why wood’s strength and hardness will be different for the same sample when measured in unique orientations. The directional dependency of a physical property is easily found in most natural materials. Fiberreinforced composites and composite materials, in general, are highly anisotropic, displaying greater strength along the grain/ﬁber direction than across it. Anisotropy is central to the structuring of materials and their behaviors. In the ﬁelds of Material Science and Engineering, the concept of anisotropy is tightly linked to a material’s microstructure deﬁned by its grain growth patterns and ﬁber orientation. However, beyond such scales, anisotropy may be utilized as a design strategy. In design, examples vary depending on the type of property being examined and the manufacturing technology applied to manipulate material organization. Over the last decade, advancements in textile design have proved, yet again, the distinctive role ﬁbers play in the design of products and environments. High-performance textiles are everywhere: car-skins, skier’s helmets, spacesuits, motorcycle racing gloves, sail boats, and ropes with integrated conductive ﬁbers. Interestingly, some of these applications transcend the scale of the micro. Finally, anisotropy is without a doubt one of the most important properties for a designer operating at the heart of contemporary design culture. Its many potential interpretations as a method for controlling material organizations seem incredibly promising in an age where developments in material science impact processes and products in design. Yet the extent to which anisotropy is explored as a generative means to create form is still rather limited and unexplored. If one were able to model anisotropy in digital space, prior to the actual production of form, what would it look like? 3.4.2 Towards an Artiﬁcial Anisotropy

Gordon’s seminal book The New Science of Strong Materials or Why You Don’t Fall through the Floor (Gordon 1976) proposes that a new science of strong materials is emerging as designers are able to modify and improve materials by understanding their behavior. Gordon predicts that the coming new engineering materials will resemble much improved versions of wood and bone more than they will the

Nature’s Way: Environmentally Informed Structural Heterogeneity 75

metals with which most contemporary engineers are familiar3.2 . One may consider that this new age of engineering materials allows the architect to move from a culture of material selection to that of material design. Such is the case of textile-inspired building concepts that have been addressed recently by a number of design practitioners in the ﬁeld. The FESTO company for example has been investing in research and development of extreme textiles for inﬂatable structures. Most recently, Philip Beesley and Sean Hanna have contributed to an important publication highlighting design achievements in extreme textiles as part of a major exhibition displayed at the Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum in 2005 (McQuaid and Beesley 2005). In the chapter “Transformed Architecture” (McQuaid and Beesley 2005), Beesley and Hanna identify the advantages of textile structures designating them as highly ﬂexible, strong and lightweight. An example of the exploitation of these concepts are Peter Testa’s carbon-ﬁber towers which offer a strategy to eliminate joints and abrupt changes in material by producing continuous extrusions of carbon-ﬁber composite cables. 3.5 The Promise of Composites: Towards a Natural Artiﬁce

It is well accepted that the properties exhibited by structural materials are governed by their chemical composition and the spatial arrangements of their constituents across multiple scales. The quest for superior material properties has typically been dominated by sources of raw materials and discoveries in processing conditions. Signiﬁcant improvements in material science and engineering, however, have afforded the designer with the ability to design microstructure-property relationships and processes by which to control material chemistry and microstructure. With the introduction of composite materials, designers can ﬁnally prioritize material design over material selection. In the following section we review precedents from the world of craft as well as high-tech designs demonstrating the designer’s ability to control material properties and relate them to some global function. In this way, a new design approach may be promoted in which material properties may vary continuously in order to correspond to external structural or environmental requirements. 3.5.1 Foams: Variable Property Density

Foams are cellular materials which hold large quantities of air. Almost any material can be foamed, and different techniques are applied in order to foam different types of solids. Amongst them are polymers, metals, ceramics, glasses, and composites (Gibson, Tonyan et al. 1992; Gibson 1995; Gibson and Ashby 1997). When foamed, these cellular solids become lighter. This process allows the designer control over other sufﬁcient related properties such as density, thermal conductivity, Young’s modulus and compressive strength. Foams are therefore often used as shock-absorbing materials, and heat or sound insulators. In this sense, foams signiﬁcantly extend the range of properties available to the designer and engineer (Gibson, Ashby et al. 1987; Gibson and Ashby 1997) Foams are frequently classiﬁed as rigid, semi-rigid and ﬂexible. Their cells are either open or closed and, as a result, their capacity to absorb water or air, as well as their capacity to return to their initial shape after deformation, varies. There are so-called ‘delayed’ or ‘memory’ foams or viscoelastic foams, which return very slowly. Foams are commercially identiﬁed by their density (g/cm3 or kg/m3 ). Plastic foams are commonly obtained by the expansion of a gas liberated by a chemical process. Polyurethane foams are the most common: ﬂexible (for mattresses, cushions, and chairs) or rigid (expanded foams used for insulation in buildings). There are latex foams at the higher end of the market but with an average mechanical strength which as a result need protection (covering or a polymer skin). Aluminum

76 THE NEW MATERIALITY

foam very light cellular material very strong in compression is used as the core of a sandwich material or for its dramatic aesthetic aspects; copper foam for its electrical conductivity, recycled glass foam is used as an insulating covering material. 3.5.2 Composites: Variable Property Elasticity

Composites have been around for centuries. Artisans and craftsmen have throughout history exploited the diverse properties of materials as they mastered skillful techniques to combine and convert raw materials into objects of consumption and beauty (Smith 1981). Among the most primitive composite materials to have existed were straw and mud in the form of bricks for building construction. Typically, there are two categories of constituent materials - matrix and reinforcement - which make up a composite. At least one portion of each type is required. The matrix material surrounds and supports the reinforcement materials by maintaining their relative position. The reinforcements impart their special mechanical and physical properties to enhance the matrix properties. Such synergy produces material properties that are superior to many natural materials. Due to the wide variety of matrix and reinforcement materials available, the design potential of composites is incredible. 3.5.3 Functional Gradient Materials: Variable Property Synthesis

The distribution of material properties as a function of their performance requirements at micro structural scale is elegantly exempliﬁed with the development and application of Functional Gradient Materials (FGM’s). The term was developed in the mid 1980’s in Japan in the design of a hypersonic space plane project where a particular combination of materials used would be required to serve the purpose of a thermal barrier capable of withstanding a surface temperature of 2000K and a temperature gradient of 1000K across a 10mm section. The general idea of structural gradients was initially proposed for composites and polymeric materials in 1972 (Miyamoto, Kaysser et al. 1999) but it was not until the 1980’s when actual models investigating the design, fabrication and evaluation of graded structures were proposed (Figure 3.2). Functionally graded materials are a new generation of engineering materials characterized by compositional and structural variation across their volume unit, resulting in property changes in the material such as mechanical shock resistance, thermal insulation, catalytic efﬁciency and relaxation of thermal stress (Miyamoto, Kaysser et al. 1999). Spatial variation is achieved through non-uniform distribution of reinforcement phases (regions of space with unique chemical uniform and physically distinct characteristics). Reinforcements are inserted with different properties, sizes, and shapes, as well as by interchanging the roles of the reinforcement and matrix phases in a continuous manner. The resultant microstructure is characterized by continuously or discretely changing its thermal and mechanical properties at the macroscopic or continuum scale. In this way materials can be designed for speciﬁc functions and applications. Various approaches exist which are used to fabricate FGM’s such as perform processing, layer processing and melt processing. The basic structural unit of an FGM resembles biological units such as cell and tissues, and is referred to as an element or a material ingredient. Bamboo, shell, tooth and bone are all made up of graded structures consisting of chemical, physical, geometrical and biological material ingredients. The concept of FGMs is revolutionary in the areas of material science and mechanics as it allows one to fully integrate between material and structural considerations in the ﬁnal design of structural components. FGMs are applicable to many ﬁelds. In the engineering applications it is applied to cutting tools, machine parts, and engine components. Various combinations of these ordinarily incompatible functions can be

The Promise of Composites: Towards a Natural Artiﬁce 77

applied to create new materials for aerospace, chemical plants, and nuclear energy reactors. However, the application of FGMs in product and architectural design construction scale has not been thoroughly researched and developed. Functionally graded materials stand out as a special class of materials characterized by the gradual variation in composition and structure over volume, resulting in corresponding structure-property relationships. Unlike any other class of materials, FGMs are “designed materials”, assembled rather than selected for a particular function or application. Given the designer’s freedom to deﬁne the material microstructure based on its properties, any composite material could be made simply by varying the microstructure from one material to another with a speciﬁc gradient. Such processes facilitate the designer with the possibility of combining the ultimate properties of each material into one. Generally approximated by means of a power series, the transition between the two materials is achieved by combining several discrete layers, each containing localized optimal properties. Here, the notion of “units” is relevant insofar as it deﬁnes the micro-structural property of the material relative to its attributed mechanical functions. The basic unit for FGM representation is the maxel (Miyamoto, Kaysser et al. 1999). Its attributes include the location and volume fraction of individual material components. The term maxel is also used in the context of additive manufacturing processes to describe a physical voxel deﬁning the build resolution of a rapid prototyping or rapid manufacturing process, or the resolution of a design produced by such fabrication means. 3.5.4 Blurring the Boundaries between “Material” and “Structure”

The parting between “material” and “structure” in the material world, material being associated with the artiﬁcial built environment, has been the direct result of the hierarchy implied by the design process itself. Material, in the traditional sense of the word and the concept, is theoretically reduced to act as the “ﬁller of form”. By practical extension, “material” has traditionally been regarded as homogeneous and consistent in properties, effects and appearance. Only recently, with advances in composite materials and other related developments of functionally gradient materials, has the term earned meaningful semantic signiﬁcance. Today, the term “material” might as well be reconsidered as the “microstructure” of a structural component. Since designers have now gained the ability to weave plastic ﬁbers and layer wooden sheets in correspondence to particular mechanical requirements, the difference between “material” and “structure” amounts to functional scale. As we have previously determined, the distinction between material and structure in the biological world, occupies indeﬁnable territory that is at best elusive. In his book Structural Biomaterials, Julian Vincent claims that when dealing with biology from an engineering standpoint such distinctions are extremely challenging. Hair, horn, cuticle and wood all have “structure” and yet all of them are mostly treated as materials (Vincent 1982). Moreover, Vincent claims that only once a distinction has been made can such complex materials be scrutinized. According to Vincent, the conﬂict is resolved by a simple test: materials have the same stiffness in tension, bending and compression. If they don’t, we must be dealing with a structure, and the measured stiffness is not a material parameter (Vincent 1982). But, could it be, that below a certain size level of the components one does not need to consider the structure of a material and may consider it as homogeneous? According to Vincent, it is often possible to identify a size threshold below which the structure of a material does not affect its mechanical properties. The threshold changes depending on the size of the test piece and the conditions under which the test is carried out. By observing the response of the test piece, its deformation, and the size hierarchy at which the main interfacial inﬂuences occur, it is possible to determine, if we are looking at a material or a structure. A great example given by Vincent is the

78 THE NEW MATERIALITY

observation of bone fracture. In the well-mineralized bone, the functional unit is the osteon, whereas in the less-mineralized bone, the main functional unit is the collagen-hydroxyapatite ﬁber. The same could be applied to the design of products and buildings. In a groin vault for instance, structural failure may occur at the brick level (analog here to the osteon) and/or at the thrust line the line of action of the resulting compressive force connecting between the four vaults (Figure 3.3). In the former case, the brick acts both as the material and as the structure (as its boundaries determine the location of failure) whereas in the latter case, the groin vault geometry is the structure, which also happens to be made up of bricks. As a result it is relatively straightforward to assume that structural failure assists in negotiating between the domains of structure and material, and that, eventually, the distinction boils down to the scale of the functional units. Amongst other scientists who have referred to the distinction between structure and materials is Michael Ashby, is his book: Material Selection in Mechanical Design (Ashby 1995; Ashby 2005). In the chapter relating to the “selection of material and shape” (Chapter 11 in Ashby 1995), Ashby assets that natural shapes achieve structural efﬁciency through their microscopic shape. Microstructures are extensive by their very nature as they repeat themselves. Due to this nature, they can be thought of as “materials” in their own right possessing their respective modulus, strength, and density (Ashby 1995; Ashby 2005). As reviewed in the previous chapter, many natural materials such as wood, bone, stalks and leaves may be characterized by their unique repeated microstructure. Ashby carries on by claiming that provided they are large enough compared with the size of their micro-structural cells; shapes can be cut from such materials that inherit their properties. Ashby employs the term “shape” to consist of the external, macro-shape, of a given material, and the internal, or micro-shape, of the same material (Ashby 2005). A cellular structure or a honeycomb are two good such examples demonstrating micro structural solid organization (Gibson and Ashby 1997). Ashby’s macro- and micro-shape diagrams are a great example of a very clear distinction between shape and material, following Vincent’s logic and tests (Figures 3.4, 3.5). However, as we have previously seen in Nature’s Way, that there exists an intermediate scale between shape and material which deﬁnes a certain relationship between them. For example, in order to increase its stiffness and its strength, wood’s solid component made of cellulose, lignin and other polymers is shaped into very small prismatic cells which vary in density as they disperse the solids further from the axis of bending or twisting of the tree trunk and its branches (Ashby 1995). In other words, by controlling the variation of material properties as a function of the shape they relate to, Nature negotiates structure and material. Moreover, in Nature one would not be able to ﬁnd cases of “material patching” such as the ones described in Ashby’s diagrams above. Instead, the density of the shape’s micro-structure would change in order to ﬁt the function of its macro shape. A few examples may relate to the distribution of micro-structural patterns relative to the direction of load applied on the shape. For instance, ‘I’ beams would be constructed with denser patterns in the periphery and sparser ones in the center in order to account for potential buckling, bending and twisting, while also saving material. We shall refer to such strategy as a Material Distribution Function. 3.6 3.6.1 Slow Craft: Low-Tech Cases in Material-based Design The Wavy Hamon, a Swordsmith’s Dilemma: a Case in Material Conditioning

How does one create a sword both strong enough to hold a sharp edge and soft enough to bend? Beset with the ﬁnest details of material craft, Viking and medieval European swords have long had staying power as objets d’art and testimonies of engineering genius. Heated, welded, cut, forged, bent and twisted, such artifacts were designed as the very substance of warfare. Striking form and practical function are combined in skillful processes of material re-surfacing and structuring.

Slow Craft: Low-Tech Cases in Material-based Design 79

The ﬁnished sword’s function and performance were determined by its shape, proportion, and its physical properties. The steel had just about the right combination of hardness and toughness as it was repeatedly welded to reﬁne its structure before forging the blade (Figures 3.6-3.10). The shifting colors during heating indicated the temperature of the glowing steel. At the right moment and the optimal temperature, the blade was taken from the hearth quenched in water or oil. Finally it was tempered to eliminate brittleness. The blade, as a result, was hard enough to hold a keen edge but was still ﬂexible enough not to break during use (Smith 1981). Pristine in its entirety, yet the creation of the Samurai sword surmounted a technological impossibility: the blade has to be forged in order to hold a very sharp edge and, concurrently, not break in the ferocity of a dual. To create steel both brittle (it must be hard enough to take a sharp edge), and soft (it must not break) was an almost unfeasible metallurgical challenge. In seeking to settle the swordsmith’s dilemma, Japanese sword artisans used a combination of four metal bars each holding different properties. A soft iron bar guarded against the potential breaking of the blade, two hard iron bars prevented bending and a steel bar took a sharp cutting edge. All four bars were heated at a high temperature and then hammered together into a long rectangular bar that would become the sword blade. As the swordsmith ground the blade to sharpen it, the steel took the razor-sharp edge, while the softer metal ensured the blade would not break. This intricate forging process brought about the wavy hamon, or ‘temper line’ a major qualiﬁer in judging a blade’s artistic merit. 3.6.2 Great Mosque of Djenn´ and the First Composites: a Case in Material Composition e

Adobe bricks are the earliest case of material composites known. They serve as a natural building material composed of sand mixed with water, straw and other organic materials shaped into bricks using wooden frames and dried evenly in the sun. The straw is useful in binding the brick together while allowing it to dry evenly. Bricks are made in an open frame, and the mixture is molded by the frame before its removal. After drying, the bricks are turned on edge to ﬁnish drying. The same mixture to make bricks, without the use of the straw, is used for mortar and often for plaster on interior and exterior walls. Some ancient cultures used lime-based cement for the plaster to protect against rain damage. An adobe wall has major environmental effects as it can serve as a heat reservoir due to its relatively dense thermal mass; therefore this type of construction is most useful in tropical climates. The Great Mosque of Djenn´ is the largest adobe building in the world and is considered by many to e be one of the greatest achievements of the Sudano-Sahelian architectural style, with Islamic inﬂuences (Figure 3.11). Its walls are made of sun-baked mud bricks called ferey, a type of mud based mortar, and are coated with a mud plaster which gives the building its smooth, sculpted look. Wall thickness varies depending on its height: taller sections were traditionally built thicker because the base has to be wide enough to support the weight. Bundles of palm wood were included in the building to reduce cracking caused by frequent drastic changes in humidity and temperature and to serve as readymade scaffolding for annual repairs. The walls insulate the building from heat during the day and by nightfall have absorbed enough heat to keep the mosque warm through the night. 3.6.3 The Baidarka Kayak: a Case in Material Assembly

A Kayak is a hunter’s boat, some of which are at least 4000 years old. The boat’s primary purpose was to hunt animals on inland lakes, rivers and the sea. The Kayak was made of seal skins and wood (Figures 3.12, 3.13). The wood was driftwood that was collected from beaches, since many of the areas where kayaks were paddled are void of the land-based raw materials used in making birch bark or dugout canoes. The baidarka kayak is a special kayak. The word refers to the double and triple kayaks developed

80 THE NEW MATERIALITY

by the Alaskan Aleut. The baidarka kayak (Iceland, 1806) meshes small pieces of bone into a wooden superstructure in strategic zones requiring maximum flexibility. This technique illustrates an early example of a composite material with non-homogenous properties, since the combination of bone, wood, and leather contribute to the local variance of the boat’s rigidity along its length. An exterior performance parameter, such as the floating of the boat on waves, becomes the incentive to manipulate not only its shape (as it happens in the design of all boats), but also its locally adjusted material composition (Class notes from MIT Class 4.195, Special Problems in Architectural Design, Alexandros Tsamis-Jimmy Shen, Exercise III: Material Deployment Investigation, 2005, based on Dyson, 2002). The variety of skin-on-frame kayaks made by the Aleuts of Alaska is typically called “Baidarkas”. The big advantage for the traditional builders of skin-on-frame kayaks, the Aleut and Inuit residents of the far north, is that they could be built with the materials on hand. The frame did not require big pieces of wood and could be made with material that drifts up on the beach. The skin was made from their primary food species, the seal. This set up an interesting chicken-and-egg situation, because they needed the kayak to catch seals and they need seals to make the kayak. The resulting boat was light weight, rugged, resilient and easy to maintain. Due to the construction technique and materials used, any skin on frame boat is inherently flexible. There is some thought that this hull flexibility also offers some efficiency advantages. 3.6.4 Weaving the First Hut: a Case in Material Organization

Weaving is an ancient textile craft that involves placing two sets of threads or yarn made of ﬁber on a loom and turning them into cloth. In general, weaving involves the interlacing of two sets of threads at right angles to each other: the warp and the weft. The warp are held taut and in parallel by means of a loom. The loom is warped (or dressed) with the warp threads passing through heddles on two or more harnesses. The warp threads are moved up or down by the harnesses creating a space called the shed. The weft thread is wound onto spools called bobbins. The bobbins are placed in a shuttle which carries the weft thread through the shed. The raising/lowering sequence of warp threads gives rise to many possible weave structures from the simplest plain weave, through complex computer-generated interlacings (Figure 3.14). Both warp and weft can be visible in the ﬁnal p roduct. By spacing the warp more closely, it can completely cover the weft that binds it, giving a warp faced textile. Conversely, if the warp is spread out, the weft can slide down and completely cover the warp, giving a weft faced textile, such as a tapestry or a Kilim rug. There are a variety of loom styles for hand weaving and tapestry. In tapestry, the image is created by placing weft only in certain warp areas, rather than across the entire warp width. The practice of hut and basket weaving demonstrate interesting ways by which ﬁbers can be distributed to correspond with required local strength and ﬂexibility. 3.7 Rapid Craft: High-Tech Cases in Material-based Design

The following case-studies - both from the domain of extreme sports - illustrate the signiﬁcance of variable property design achieved by the development of high-end composites and their respective fabrication technologies. 3.7.1 Pole-vaulting: A Case Study in Stiffness Variation

If its novel, it’s in the Olympics. The Olympic Games have traditionally constituted a major opportunity for the sports to celebrate advances in engineering. Such is the case with pole vaulting. Pole vaulting, as an athletic activity, dates back to the ancient Greeks and its development, as a bendable beam used for jumping, illustrates how the shift to composites resulted in major athletic performance improvements (Figure 3.15).

Slow Craft: Low-Tech Cases in Material-based Design 81

Beam stiffness is a signiﬁcant concept for many types of structures, particularly those shaped with slender proportions, such as trees, skyscrapers, bones and chairs. Inadequate beam stiffness could lead to large deﬂections, high localized stresses and failure in a particular region. In addition to bending moments, such structures may be subjected to twisting and torsional moments (torques). Pole-vaults are a great example of stiffness variation designed to account for its special performance. In pole-vaulting, the highest stresses occur on the outside of the bent beam. In addition, within the middle zone of the pole, positioned across its height and known as its neutral axis, there are minimum or no stresses at all. There is, therefore, no need to place any material mass down its center. Bamboo for instance, which is a naturally hollow material, is much lighter per unit length than a solid pole - yet provides the same maximum stress. Give that pole-vaulting essentially involves the conversion of the kinetic energy of the running athlete to the potential energy of the jump using strain energy stored in the pole (the energy stored in elastic deformation), a lighter pole enables an athlete carrying a bamboo pole to take a faster run-up or to use a slightly longer pole. Poles were originally made out of solid wood, probably hickory. Slightly more ﬂexible bamboo poles were introduced in the early 1900s and a sharp increase in the achievable height coincided with the advent of composite poles made of ﬁberglass, about 50 years ago. In its elastic recovery, these poles are sufﬁciently strong and ﬂexible to allow substantial amounts of energy to be transformed into elastic strain energy stored in the deformed pole, and consequently transformed again into potential energy. The mechanics of beam bending is clearly integral to this phenomenon. The sharp increase in achievable height that coincided with the switch to composite poles was due to a change in the mechanics of pole vaulting. Bamboo or metal poles with sufﬁcient ﬂexibility to allow signiﬁcant energy storage would, respectively, be likely to fracture or plastically deform. Today, pole vaults are made by wrapping pre-cut sheets of ﬁberglass around a metal mandrel to produce a slightly pre-bent pole that would bend easily under compression with the athlete’s take-off. The weights, length and stiffness of the pole are a function of the density and directionality of carbon ﬁbers as they are laid out on the composite sheets. 3.7.2 Extreme Sailing: A Case Study in Elastic Variation

Boat builders were amongst the very ﬁrst to experiment with carbon-reinforced composites. As early as the 1970’s the pioneering innovator Edward S. (“TED”) Van Dusen discovered that most standard construction materials had about the same speciﬁc stiffness per unit weight. This led him to experimenting with composites and making the ﬁrst carbon-ﬁber composite Advantage racing shells (McQuaid and Beesley 2005). Satin weaves made of glass ﬁber in complex twill afforded Van Dusen the opportunity to locally inform the physical behavior of the sail. Within the weave each weft may ﬂoat over as many as seven warps. With fewer points of intersection, the ﬁber has less stability, but more ﬁber can be packed into the structure. The density minimizes the risk of pinholes forming in the composite, keeping the boat watertight. The dependency between the ﬁbers’ material properties and their structural geometry, and their ordering organizations, are all contributors to the performance of the sail (Figure 3.16). The 1980’s experienced exponential growth in the ﬁeld of textile design when high-performance ﬁbers such as aramids and carbon ﬁbers have been a major force driving the markets and industries of aerospace and the military (McQuaid and Beesley 2005). As composite reinforcements, textiles offer a high level of customization with regard to type and weight of ﬁber, use of combinations of ﬁbers, and use of different weaves to maximize the density of ﬁbers in a given direction (McQuaid and Beesley 2005). Fiber strength is greatest along the length. The strength of composite materials derives from the intentional use of this directional nature. Fibers are considered high-performance, if they possess exceptional strength, strength-to-weight ratio, chemical or ﬂame resistance, or range of operating temperatures. Weaving, braiding, knitting and em-

broidery have existed for centuries. However, combined with an ability to locally control reinforcement, high performance ﬁbers are contributing to incredible leaps in the performance of products and buildings alike. 3.8 3.8.1 Design beyond Selection: Current Problems Limitations Patch Hide: the Problem with Smart Materials

As new research avenues ﬁnd practical expression within design and architectural practice, it is clear that the design of better, lighter, stronger, more effective and efﬁcient materials will be moving the industry forward. The design and control of a material’s micro-structure is seemingly coupled with any potential real-time behaviors that may be incorporated into its functional portrait. So signiﬁcant and far-reaching is the progress occurring in the area of smart-materials that one ﬁnds it hard to avoid addressing its relevant and contribution in this context. What distinguishes a smart material from a traditional one is that for both traditional and high-performance materials there is a mostly ﬁxed response to external stimuli. In other words, for a traditional material, properties remain constant under standard conditions (Addington and Schodek 2005)3.3 . Smart materials on the other hand, are either property changing or energy exchanging (or both). Property changing materials trigger intrinsic response variation that is speciﬁc to any given internal or external stimuli. Energy exchanging responses trigger extrinsic response variation that can be computationally controlled or enhanced. There also exist combinations of such classes of materials in smart devices and systems in which smart materials are embedded in devices or systems with intrinsic response variations and related computational enhancements to multiple internal or external stimuli or controls. Finally, intelligent environments combine intrinsic and cognitively guided response variations of whole environments comprised of smart devices and systems to use conditions and internal or external stimuli. The main problem behind such environments is that they are typically patched atop an existing structural or architectural system. Such “patching” strategies result in functional assemblies and kinetically actuated facades and products which require much energy to operate, and are typically maintained by global control. It is an assumption of the research that next-generation construction materials may support dynamic (in addition to their currently, static) spatially-differentiated material compositions and structural forms. The aim is to combine structural, optical, and ﬂuidic behaviors which are governed by the material architecture, as well as the interactions between materials and their environment. Such material architectures could simultaneously bear large structural load, change their transparency so as to control light levels within a building or vehicle, and open and close embedded pores so as to ventilate a space. 3.8.2 Fabricating Difference: the Problem of Material Scale

Achieving structural heterogeneity in micro-structural levels to accommodate for varying (anticipated) load conditions is promising insofar as it may be applied to projects of micro-structural scale. The main problem arises when we attempt to translate some of these meso-scale capabilities, as exempliﬁed through the use of foams, composites and FGMs, into macro-scale architectural and engineering design problems. Imagine, for instance, that a singular beam or better yet, an entire building system, could be

The volume includes a comprehensive account of smart materials, their classiﬁcation and characterization across various scales, as well as the inclusion of elements and control systems integrated into materials such as sensors and micro-electrical mechanical systems. The book concludes with a classiﬁcation of components and assemblies applied to facades, lighting systems, energy systems and structural systems.

constructed out of variable-property concrete so as to modulate its density as a function of anticipated loading conditions. Variable-property design at construction scale is yet to succeed in challenging conventional full-scale construction systems. Indeed, architectural building codes and standards often supersede performance criteria with an attempt to simplify the selection process and remove liability for performance failures (Addington and Schodek 2005). Frequently, this supersedes results in the simpliﬁcation of material composition with the aim of homogenizing the construction process in order to subscribe to performance standards. In Nature however, as we have seen, “every tree is different”. It logically follows then, that mechanisms for the production of difference in material performance must be integrated with industrial construction processes before we may achieve Nature’s Way. To paraphrase, modern construction methods prioritize efﬁciency over effectiveness, whereas Nature combines efﬁciency and effectiveness in ingenious ways. There are some relevant sources worth exploring in this context. One such case is John Fernandez’ Material Architecture (Fernandez 2006) which inspires the conceptual, methodological and practical shift from the material scale to that of construction, not without responding to building codes promoting sustainable design methods. Accompanied by essays and studies profoundly geared towards topics of sustainable design and construction, the book highlights the role of emerging materials in contemporary practice and offers a comprehensive and synthetic understanding of the topic in architectural design today. It highlights the condition that general structures of materials behave quite differently at the micro and macro levels, and that such behaviors must be accounted for when translating from micro to macro scale as the structure of a material at each of these levels will strongly inﬂuence its ﬁnal characteristics and properties. It is thus imperative to reconsider the mechanisms and technologies promoting structural heterogeneity in building scale. 3.8.3 Load over Light: The Problem of Disciplinary-based Parameterization

In the milieu of design, the concept of material performance encompasses many, and often conﬂicting, interpretations which vary as we have seen previously - with the type and method of property classiﬁcation. Central to the deﬁnition and utilization of material performance parameters and their dimensions, is the distinction between criteria associated with architectural, or design performance and those associated with engineering performance. While the engineering disciplines prioritize structural integrity and environmental soundness against building loads, seismic loads and wind loads, to name a few, the architect in her consideration of comfort and well-being searches for spatial qualities of, and in relation to spatial distribution, visibility, and occupant comfort. As a result, many parameters must be re-negotiated in order to account for the various families of constraints. 3.8.4 From Structuring Materials to Designing Form: The Problem of Structural Hierarchy

Last but not least is the question regarding the origin of form. It is relatively easy to imagine how certain of these ideas may apply to the structuring of an already existing form in terms of its physical or material expression. Clearly, the form of human bone is determined by anatomical constraints which, in turn, comply with the physiological and chemical process involved in the distribution of cancellous bone matter. In other words, the structural (and otherwise, environmental) distribution of matter per a given boundary condition deﬁning global form is not too challenging to imagine. It is, however, quite a complex design mission to develop a process in which the generation of form goes hand in hand with its substance formation.

84 THE NEW MATERIALITY

Granted, there are numerous approaches to the structuring of materials per a given form. However, the question still remains what are the implications of allowing form to emerge as a function of material properties and environmental constraints, and how might such an approach be facilitated in and by design? We will attempt to answer this question and the other problematic highlighted above in the following chapter. 3.9 Matter over Shape: Towards Material-based Design Computation

The implications of controlling material heterogeneity at building scales from a design perspective are immense, especially in terms of efﬁciencies and effectiveness of both products and processes and their capacity to respond to external local requirements and pressures. But how to move from substance variation to formal expression and from material to construction scale is among the core questions of this work. We assume that if we were able to compute the distribution of matter as a function of structural and environmental performance, we would be able not only to control substance variation deﬁned per a given boundary condition, but better still, we could utilize such methods for the generation of form itself. Given that we are now well aware of such an ambition, drawing from Nature’s Way (Chapter 2); and given that the range of material possibilities with their various scales have been sufﬁciently reviewed in this chapter, we are now ready to explore the potential of computational process to computationally support and instrumentalize a material-based design approach. The ability to strategically utilize and exploit relationships between the spatial arrangements of material constituents and their bulk properties across various length scales will make possible the future description of material properties in terms of architectural parameters and qualities. Moreover, as heterogeneity and multi-functionality (both of which are representations of morphological adaptation) become designable - as this thesis will demonstrate the ability to independently manipulate material properties and develop structural materials with vastly superior properties corresponding to their environmental surroundings will be achieved. Such exploitation of the architectural features of materials, structures and spaces will expand and enhance the design space as structural properties are negotiated with environmental ones without compromising functionality. Already, the applications of materials with such controlled micro-structural architectures are pervasive, and will result in breakthrough improvements in strength, stiffness, fracture toughness, energy absorption, thermal conductivity, thermal expansion and weight. Coupled with environmental constraints, controlled heterogeneity of material properties and effects may eventually reproduce Nature’s Way.

4.1

From Computer Aided-Design to Design Computation: an Introduction

The use of computer technology for the design of objects, real or virtual, has been supported by the plethora of applications associated with computer-aided design, also known as CAD. Developed primarily as a digital substitute for manual drafting of technical and engineering drawings, the output of CAD typically conveys symbolic information such as shape compositions, dimensions, and tolerances based on application-speciﬁc conventions. CAD is extensively used across various disciplines with many domain-speciﬁc applications including those for the automotive, shipbuilding, and aerospace industries, industrial and architectural design, among others. Within the ﬁeld of architectural design, CAD is a major driving force for research in computational ﬁelds such as computational geometry, computer graphics and discrete differential geometry. Furthermore, CAD occupies a wide variety of design applications ranging from modeling (digital generation in the digital domain), to analysis (digital mapping of the physical domain), to digital fabrication (physical generation of the digital domain). The ubiquitous and nearly pervasive use of computer-aided design, engineering and manufacturing (respectively known as CAD, CAE, and CAM) in architecture, frequently serves in current design practice as the facilitative technology by which to materialize the contemporary predilection for complex geometries and, so called, free-form design. In this sense such computer-aided environments might well be considered as the automated extension of traditional form description and form-making processes that preceded CAD’s invention (Oxman 2007; Oxman 2007; Oxman 2008). 4.1.1 From Aid to Engine

Digital extensions of traditional, conventionalized design methodological processes have earned legitimacy and value as aids in supporting mediated design. Aiding the reformulation or pre-conceived form,

The Crisis of Form 99

such tools fall short of incorporating material properties and behavior constraints, as well as fabrication and construction processes inherent to them. Indeed, in dismissing the capacity of computational tools to support form-generation processes motivated by objectives other than the generation of form itself, computer-aided design appears as a whole to facilitate a status of “more of the same”. As a result, the world of architectural design, now so saturated with excessive formal expression, continues to be dominated by top-down design decisions favoring form over material with their subsequent implications on the built environment. Looks, however, is not all that matters. In cultivating design processes inspired by Nature’s way we seek to employ alternative computational processes supporting the generation of form based on the interaction between material and environment. This entails a shift from computationally assistive processes to processes of a generative and performative nature. In other words, we aim to move from computer aided design to material-based design computation. This transformation potentially allows the designer to perform form generative processes while addressing material and environmental considerations. This new medium of performance and materialbased generation also potentially allows the designer to achieve forms of a material-ecological nature, that is, a new vocabulary otherwise unattainable. 4.1.2 Objectives and Organization

The objective of this chapter is to review the evolution of concepts and issues in the ﬁeld of design computation that are relevant to these general objectives and to characterize the emergence of a contemporary theoretical discourse and technical developments in Material-based Design Computation4.1 . It is important to note that all prior research into physically related computation resulted from the objectives to capture, or trace, pre-generated form. Consequently there is no research dedicated to questions of how to design form based upon the properties of material. It will be demonstrated that such an approach will enable us to move from the digital manifestation of physical form to its physical manifestation of digital form in a unique computational design process. The chapter includes a survey of relevant techniques in computational design that support form-generation processes within computational geometry environments. Examples of such techniques include particle systems, multi-agent systems, network analysis, and ﬁnite element methods among others. The aim here is to explore such computational design precedents and demonstrate how inherently related or removed are such techniques from the projected material processes of form-generation. 4.2 Natural Computing: Design Computing Inspired by Nature

Natural Computing is the terminology introduced by de Castro to encompass three approaches in the relationship between nature and computation (De Castro 2006). In these approaches, models of natural processes are used as a source of inspiration for the development of tools, techniques and technologies for solving complex problems in various domains from engineering to biology. Those three approaches may be classiﬁed according to the type of problems they attempt to deal with, among them: search, simulation, and physical processing.

Early research in Material-based Design Computation pioneered the consolidation of disciplines such as material science, engineering and computation in the context of design and design process. Computational processes have been identiﬁed that integrate performance criteria with form-generation processes (Oxman, 2005; 2006; 2007 2008).
