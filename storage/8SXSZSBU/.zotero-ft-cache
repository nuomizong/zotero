Abstract-A finite element analysis of the large deflection behaviour of stiffened plates using the isoparametric quadratic stiffened plate bending element is presented. The evaluation of fundamental equations of the stiffened plates is based on Mindlin’s hypothesis. The large deflection equations are based on von KBrmBn’s theory. The solution algorithm for the assembled nonlinear equilibrium equations is based on the Newton-Raphson iteration technique. Numerical solutions are presented for rectangular plates and skew stiffened plates.

INTRODUCTION

Stiffened plate structures are very common in present day engineering, and are indispensable in aerospace and ship-building disciplines. The wings or fuselage of an aircraft consist of a skin with an array of stiffening ribs. The hull of a ship, its deck and superstructure, a road bridge or the launching pedestal of a rocket are only a few examples of stiffened plate structures. Problems involving deformations of the order of the thickness of the plate are called large deflection problems. Deformations of an elastic body can also be of a magnitude that does not overstrain the material or produce stretching under large deformations and thus lead to curvature-displacement nonlinearity. Since this is deformation dependent, it is also classified as geometrical nonlinearity. There are only a very few investigators who have studied the large deflection behaviour of stiffened plates and hence only a meagre literature is available in this field. Srinivasan and Ramachandran [I] have made large deflection analysis of skew stiffened plates with eccentric stiffeners using the integral equation method. The stiffened plate is idealized as an equivalent anisotropic bare plate in their formulation. As such, all the drawbacks inherent with their idealization such as the requirement that the stiffeners should be identical, light and equally spaced hold good. Olson and Koko [2] have used superelements for large deflection elasto-plastic analysis of stiffened plates. The formulation has been made for rectangular plates only where the stiffeners must pass through nodal lines. The results have indicated over estimation of deflections and under estimation of stresses. The main purpose of the present investigation is to study the large deflection behaviour of stiffened plate structures by an efficient and accurate finite element method. The bending deformation follows Mindlin’s

hypothesis. The large deflection analysis is based on von KinnAn’s nonlinear plate equations. The isoparametric quadratic stiffened plate bending element with five degrees of freedom per node, which has so far been limited to linear analysis [3-61, has now been extended to study the nonlinear behaviour of stiffened plates. The main feature of this element is that the formulation is based in a general manner without disturbing the position or the properties of the stiffeners. Even a stiffener having arbitrary orientation within an element remains undisturbed. Further, the element being isoparametric quadratic, irregular boundaries of the structure, and also the transverse shear deformations of the plate, and the stiffeners can be very conveniently accommodated. The nonlinear equations are solved iteratively using the NewtonRaphson technique. Several numerical examples depicting the range of problems involving rectangular and skew stiffened plates have been solved.
2. PROPOSED ANALYSIS

The evaluation of the fundamental equations of the stiffened plate structure is based on the following assumptions: I. The material of the plate and the stiffener obeys Hooke’s law. 2. The bending deformation follows Mindlin’s hypothesis. Therefore, the linear elements perpendicular to the middle plane of the plate before bending remain straight, but not necessarily normal to the middle plane after bending. 3. The deflection in the Z-direction is a function of x and y only. 4. The transverse normal stresses are neglected. 5. The lateral deflection is moderate. An eight-noded isoparametric quadratic element [4] is chosen for the proposed analysis. The detailed

derivation is given in [4], so it is not repeated here. In this element, serendipity shape functions are used to interpolate both coordinates and displacements. So the coordinate at any point within the element is

where x,, y, are the coordinates and N, is the quadratic serendipity shape function corresponding to the node r. Similarly, the displacement components at any point within the element are

where [D] is the elasticity matrix, [S] is the initial stress matrix, [B,,] is the linear strain matrix and [BJ is the nonlinear strain matrix. The nonlinear strain matrix can again be written as

where U,, V,, W, are the displacements and O,, and f$, are the rotations made by normals about the y and x axes, respectively. The formulation presented here is based on the total Lagrangian coordinate system and it is given elsewhere in detail [7,8]. So the final forms are directly picked up with the standard notations used. The equilibrium equation and its incremental form is given below

where [A] is dependent on the displacements, but [G] is free from that. The element stiffness matrix of a stiffened plate element consists of the contribution of the plate and the stiffener.

2.2. Arbitrarily oriented stiffener element An eccentric stiffener within the plate element with arbitrary orientation is a general case. The stiffener properties are taken at the Gauss points in the tangential direction of the stiffener. This gives results in a different local axes system say, x’, y’ and it is converted into the global axes system accordingly. The contribution of the stiffener nonlinearity has not been considered, as its effect is negligible in the global response. A detailed derivation is given in [4], so it is only mentioned briefly. The generalized strain components of the stiffener in the x’, y’ axis system are

With the help of eqn (2) the strain vector (L}, can be written as (24) where

A method to study the large deflection behaviour of stiffened plates under bending by isoparametric quadratic bending elements and the corresponding computer program in FORTRAN 77 have been developed. To verify the validity of the method and the program, a wide variety of plates and stiffened plates have been analysed. The range covers different plates with various arrangements of stiffeners and stiffener geometries, with different boundary conditions. The stiffened plates selected for the analysis are those which are analysed by earlier investigators. 3.1. Square clamped plate
To check the formulation and the computer program, a clamped square plate is analysed. This is a standard example used by different investigators [7,9] to study the large deflection behaviour of plates. The details of the plate is given in Fig. 5 of [7]. The plate is analysed on the basis of 8 x 8 mesh division and the tolerance of convergence is taken as I %. The central deflection and stresses at the centre and edge of the plate are compared in Tables I and 2. The tables indicate good agreement of the results.

3.2. Clamped rectangular plate with single stiffener A rectangular plate stiffened by a central eccentric stiffener along the shorter direction is analysed by the proposed method using a mesh division of 10 x 5 for the quarter plate. The plate is also solved by Olson and Koko [2] by using a superelement model and by Sheikh [lo] by the spline finite strip method. The details of the plate are given in Fig. 6 of [2]. The deflections and stresses at the centre of the plate and the panel are compared with those of Olson

Clamped DRES stlflened panel The stiffened plate was constructed at the Defence Research Establishment in Suffield (DRES), Alberta, Canada [l l] and a static analysis was done using the general purpose computer program ADINA [12]. It is a rectangular plate with four equispaced eccentric stiffeners with four edges clamped. The details of the plate is given in Fig. 11 of [2]. The quarter plate is analysed on the basis of a 10 x 5 mesh division. The stiffened plate is solved by Olson and Koko [2] using a superelement model and also by Sheikh [lo] using the spline finite strip method. The deflection and bending moments at the centre of the plate are compared with those of Olson and Koko, ADINA and Sheikh in Table 5. The normal stress at the top of the plate, perpendicular to the stiffener at the centre of the inner stiffener is compared with that of Sheikh [lo] in Table 6. The results agree reasonably well. 3.4. Clamped skew stifSened plate The stiffened plate studied in example 2 is converted to a skew plate with an included angle of 60” (Fig. 1). This skew stiffened plate is analysed to check the formulation applicable to the analysis of plates having general shape and boundary condition with arbitrary stiffener orientation. The analysis is done on the basis of a 10 x 6 mesh size. The same plate is analysed by Sheikh[lO] using the spline finite strip method. The deflection and the bending moment at the panel centre for the different load levels are given in Table 7.
Y

Deflections compare well; the stress values have differed slightly for higher load levels.

5. CONCLUSIONS The eight-noded isoparametric plate bending element is used to study the large deflection behaviour of stiffened plates. The formulation is generalized so that the stiffener may pass anywhere within the element and need not pass through the nodal line. This gives a considerable amount of flexibility in the mesh generation. The formulation is based on an isoparametric element using Mindlin’s hypothesis. So the shear deformation is taken into account and the arbitrary stiffener orientation and plate shape can be easily handled. Five degrees of freedom per node have been considered. Large deflection analysis is based on von K&man’s nonlinear plate theory. The solution algorithm used for solving the nonlinear equations is the Newton-Raphson method. Comparison with the published results indicates good correlation.
