SUMMARY
An assessment of flat triangular plate bendingelementswith displacementdegrees-of-freedomat the three comer nodes only is presented, with the purpose of identifyingthe most effective for thin plate analysis. Based on a review of currently available elements, specific attention is given to the theoretical and numerical evaluation of three triangular 9 degrees-of-freedom elements; namely, a discrete Kirchhoff element, a hybrid stress model (HSM) element and a selective reduced integration (SRI) theory (DKT) element. New and efficient formulationsof these elements are discussed in detail and the results of several example analyses are given. It is concluded that the most efficient and reliable three-node plate bending elements are the DKT and HSM elements.

1. INTRODUCTION Since the earliest development of the finite element method, a considerable amount of research has been devoted to the analysis of plate and shell structures. A great number of papers have been published on this subject (see, for example, the review papers by Gallagher''2). Considering the research and development efforts, various approaches, theories and variational principles to formulate plate and shell elements have been used to circumvent the difficulties that arise in the analysis of general plates and shells. However, despite the amount of research that has been devoted to the subject, further research effort is still required to provide the practising engineers with reliable, cost-effective and accurate computer to solve various plate assemblies and complex shell problems. In essence, three approaches are being followed in the development of plate and shell elements:

1. A particular shell theory is used and discreti~,ed.'*~ 2. Three-dimensional continuum equations are used and discretized (isoparametric elements) (References 6 and 7, etc.). 3. Plate bending and membrane element stiffnesses are superimposed and assembled in a global co-ordinate system (References 8 and 9, etc.).
The three approaches have advantages and disadvantages, and it is still difficult to state which o f the three approaches is most effective based on criteria combining accuracy, computational cost and simplicityin use (in the data input phase as well as in the interpretation of results). Approach 3 received a great deal of attention for the linear analysis of shell structures in the mid-l960s," but the activities related to approaches 1 and 2 have dominated the past 10 years. It is only recently that a new impetus has been given to the analysis of shells using approach 3. 0029-598 1/80/ 1215-177 1$01.OO @ 1980 by John Wiley & Sons,Ltd.

Considering this approach, triangular flat elements having displacements and rotations at the corner nodes as degrees-of-freedom-the engineering dof-are particularly appealing for many practical reasons; for example, arbitrary shell geometries, general supports and cut-outs, and beam stiffeners can be modelled. These elements have a total of 18 dof (3 translations and 3 rotations at each node) or 15 dof (3 translations and 2 rotations) depending on whether the rotation about the normal is included as a dof. The element formulation is based on a superposition of membrane and bending actions. Among the most recent papers on this subject, References 12 and 13deal with the linear analysis, whereas References 9,14,8 and 15 deal with f the geometrically nonlinear analysis o shells with large displacements and rotations. In References 1 2 , 9 and 14 the hybrid stress formulations are used, whereas in References 13, 8 and 15, displacement-type formulations are employed. A very important consideration in the development of these shell elements is the representation of the bending behaviour. Although several theoretical and numerical studies on plate bending finite elements have appeared in the past 15 years, a detailed recent study and comparison of triangular plate bending elements with only 3 dof at the corner nodes (displacement w and rotations & and By,as shown in Figure 1) is not available.

In this paper we present the results of a detailed theoretical and numerical study of triangular plate bending elements with 9 corner dof only. The objective in this study was to identify or develop an optimum element for the general linear analysis of plate bending problems. Our ultimate aim is to employ this element as the basis of a 3-noded shell element that can be used effectively for general geometric and material nonlinear analysis of thin shells. In our work specific attention was given to the soundness of the theoretical formulation, the numerical efficiency and reliability of the plate bending elements. It is apparent that very accurate and efficient elements can be developed for the analysis of specific problems only. However, unless

an element always yields a stable solution, it cannot be recommended for use in a general analysis computer program, where reliability of analysis results is of utmost concern. These thoughts are particularly important in geometric nonlinear analysis in which the structural configuration changes continuously, and it is impractical and dangerous to apply ârulesâ that tell under what boundary conditions and for which structural shapes an element can be employed. f In this paper we first review alternative formulations o 3-noded triangular plate bending elements that have been presented in the literature. This review suggests giving specific attention to the theoretical formulation and numerical evaluation of three elements: a DKT (discrete Kirchhoff theory) element, a HSM (hybrid stress model) element and a SRI (selective reduced integration) element. New and compact formulations of these elements are given in the paper, and to identify the relative effectiveness of the elements the results of various sample analyses using these elements are presented. 2. REVIEW OF TRIANGULAR PLATE BENDING ELEMENTS WITH 9 D O F In this section we review the formulation and behaviour o the available triangular plate bending f elements with 9 dof: the displacement w and the rotations 6, and 8, at the three corner nodes. The converged solution is the classical Kirchhoff thin plate solution. These elements can be classified as 1. Displacement models based on the classical Kirchhoff thin plate theory. 2. Hybrid stress models based also on the Kirchhoff plate theory. 3. Displacement models derived from the theory of plates with transverse shear deformations.
2.1. Displacement-based Kirchhoff plate .theory elements

The early attempts to develop satisfactory triangular elements with 9 dof are reported in References 16 and 17. The element formulations are based on the principle of minimum potential energy, where the compatibility requirements involve the displacements w and the rotations w,, = - 8, and w,,= 8,. Elements labelled A, T and T-10 in Reference 16 are based on cubic polynomials in local co-ordinates x and y. Their ineffectiveness is due to the following reasons: incompleteness (A), incompatibility (A, T, T-lo), lack o invariance with regard to f element orientation (T, A) and singularity (T). It was then realized that it is impossible to formulate a compatible triangular element with 9 dof with a single-field polynomial expansion for w. One of the first compatible triangular elements is the well-known HCT element.â6 Its formulation is based on the subdivision of the complete element into three subtriangles. An incomplete cubic (9-term) polynomial is used in each subregion for the displacement w,and the f normal slope along the exterior edge of each region varies linearly. The formulation o this element has also been discussed using area co-ordinateslâ (where it is called LCCT-9). The HCT element has frequently been regarded as a reference element for bending analysis of plates, mainly because of the extensive numerical results presented with its formulation. However, the formulation involves cumbersome algebraic manipulations and the element is rather stiff. The element has also been the subject of several theoretical studies (e.g. order of convergence, error estimates).â In Reference 17 a non-conforming element (labelled BCIZl in this study) and a conforming element (labelled BCIZ2) are presented. The BCIZl element is a non-conforming element that satisfies the rigid body mode and the constant strain states. The shape functions expressed in area co-ordinates are given explicitly in s o h e The important drawback o the f BCIZl element is due to its incompatibility: it does not converge to the exact answer for some

mesh patterns. The study of this drawback is given in Reference 17 and can be understood as the first application of what is now called the 'patch-test'. The BCIZ2 element is a compatible element obtained by appropriate superposition of f polynomials and rational shape functions in area co-ordinates. Due to the presence o these rational functions, a very high-order numerical integration scheme is needed (16 points in Reference 17) to evaluate the stiffness matrix. Some results for free vibrations of plates using the BCIZl and BCIZ2 elements are given in Reference 17, where better results are reported using the BCIZl element for the meshes and problems considered. The A-9" element is derived from the BCIZ2 element by replacing the true second derivatives of the shape functions with smoothed derivatives. These pseudo-derivatives are the least square linear polynomial versions of the true second derivatives, and the result is that only three numerical integration points are needed to evaluate the stiffness matrix. The pseudo-derivatives are not given explicitly in Reference 21, but good numerical results are reported for several static problems. In Reference 21 a close relationship of the A-9 element to a hybrid stress formulation has been reported. At present the A-9 element replaces the BCIZl and BCIZ2 elements in some computer codes (Reference 3, Chapter 13). In the computer program ICES-STRUDL 11, the element CPT is a 9 dof triangular element." Two subtriangles are used in the formulation. The normal slope continuity is enforced along the three sides but the transverse displacement is not inter-element continuous along one side.23 Only a few numerical results using this element have been published. 2.2. Hybrid stress elements The elements described above have been derived from the principle of minimum potential energy and the Kirchhoff plate theory. The hybrid stress (or hybrid mixed) methodz4 was developed to overcome the difficulties that are encountered in the development of pure displacement models due to element compatibility requirements. Various authors have presented hybrid stress triangular elements for plate bending problems.' The most effective and also simplest element is called the HSM element in this study. This triangular bending element is derived from the Kirchhoff plate theory. The element has a linear distribution of bending moments in the interior and a cubic displacement variation with a linear normal slope (w,") variation along the edges of the element. The formulation of the HSM element has been discussed by several a ~ t h o r s ' ~and slightly different ways have been devised to obtain the *~~-~~ f stiffness matrix depending on the expression o the functional used. The derivation of the stiffness matrices of hybrid stress elements appears to be rather cumbersome, and the evaluation of the element matrices appears to involve more algebraic manipulations and computer storage than comparative displacement models. However, some effective techniques are available to evaluate the stiffness matrix (References 9 and 26; see also Section 3.2). Extensive numerical results are available with the HSM element for static as well as free vibration analyses of plates, and it is certainly one of the most effective 9 dof triangular elements available. Its formulation is given in detail in Section 3.2, where the stiffness matrix is given in compact form. Theoretical studies related to hybrid stress models and the HSM element are found in References 26,29 and 30. In References 27 and 31 the HSM element has been derived using a hybrid displacement approach instead of the hybrid stress model. Hence, several alternatives are available to formulate the stiffness matrix of the HSM element; however, they do not seem to offer any advantage over the standard hybrid stress method as far as the derivation of the stiffness matrix is concerned. The main advantage of the hybrid displacement approach3' for deriving the HSM

element lies in the more simple and accurate calculation of consistent loads due to pressure loading. Identical numerical results to the A-9 element?' are obtained. The calculations presented in Reference 21 require more basic operations than our evaluation presented in Section 3.2, but about the same high speed storage. In Reference 51 a triangular hybrid stress element based on the theory of plates including transverse shear effects has been used to build quadrilateral elements with 12 dof. This element appears to be quite effective for plates o various length-to-thickness ratios and for sandwich f plates. Another class of 9 dof triangular elements for the analysis of Kirchhoff plates can be obtained with the so-called simplified hybrid displacement method (Reference 52 among others) by using a 10-term cubic polynomial for w and correcting the stiffness matrix (which is the same as the T-10 element in Reference 16) to restore the continuity of w," along the sides. The resulting element is a 10 dof element; the reduction to 9 dof is carried out by static condensation. A critical assessment of this triangular element is given in Reference 32, where it is shown that the stiffness matrix can in some cases be singular (after the introduction of boundary conditions). Acceptable results are reported and applications to linear and nonlinear analysis of plates and shells have been given, but the elements are not reliable. 2.3. Discrete Kirchhofftheory elements The formulation of elements based on the discrete Kirchhoff theory for bending of thin plates is obtained by first considering a theory of plates including transverse shear deformations (see Section 3.1). In this case the independent quantities are the deflection w, and the rotations pX and p, and only Cocontinuity requirements need to be satisfied. The transverse shear energy is neglected altogether and the Kirchhoff hypothesis is introduced in a discrete way along the edges of the element to relate the rotations to the transverse displacements. This approach has been used to formulate effective 9 dof triangular bending that converge to the classical thin plate solution. The element labelled QQ3 in Reference 33 and KC in Reference 36 were the most effective at the time of their presentation. Together with the HSM element they still represent the most effective 9 dof triangular plate bending elements available (QQ3 and KC are labelled DKT, discrete Kirchhoff theory, in our study). However, they are not well known, which can be attributed to several reasons. The formulation might appear to be 'strangelooking' (mathematically cloudy is the expression used in Reference 37) and the presentations used in References 33-36 are neither attractive nor simple. No special variational principle is associated with the model. Several plate and shell triangular elements based on the discrete Kirchhoff theory used subregions and/or m i d - n o d e ~ ~ ~ and* * ' ~ * ~ the potential of the basic simple elements themselves was not reco nized completely. Some researchers found the practical application of the element dificult?'or the implementation complicated.'? Furthermore, it was claimed that the element predicts stresses relatively poorly.43The final result is that the DKT element has not received widespread adoption and has also not been implemented in any major computer code. f In this paper we demonstrate the generally good behaviour o the DKT element in several analyses (Section 4). These results are also complemented by recent theoretical ~ t u d i e s . ' ~ . ~ ~ ~ . In Reference 19, an approximation theory is used to derive error estimates associated with the DKT model. It is proved that the displacements and the free vibration eigenvalues are ' converging quadratically to the C Kirchhoff solution of thin plates. The above theoretical results are in agreement with the results obtained in References 38,39 and 40. In these papers the development of Coplate bending elements of quadratic accuracy is

1776

1.-L. BATOZ, K.-J. BATHE AND L.-W. HO

thoroughly described, both theoretically and numerically. In Reference 39 a family of triangular 9 dof plate bending elements with a parameter c to control their flexibility are presented. The formulation of these elements is similar to the formulation of the DKT element and the discrete Kirchhoff constraints are also introduced along the sides. The DKT element can be considered as the element of the family presented in Reference 39 with c = O . Imposing the Kirchhoff hypothesis along the sides of the elements and keeping the transverse shear energy is somehow contradictory; however, the converged solution is the classical thin plate solution and for different values of c the convergence is quadratic (c = 0 included). Depending on the value of c, different results are obtained for coarse meshes. The choice o the optimum value of c is f therefore problem-dependent. However, the arguments and derivations given in the papers are valuable to justify the DKT element. The formulation of triangular elements for plates with C o deflection fields not described by the Kirchhoff bending theory is discussed in Reference 44.
2.4. Selective reduced integration element

Recent and somehow successful developments of a beam element, quadrilateral plate and axisymmetric shell element^,'^ based on selective reduced integration concepts and the theory of plates including transverse shear effects, suggest that a simple f selectively integrated triangular plate element with 9 dof may be effective. The formulation o such an element is presented in Section 3.3 and some numerical results using the element are summarized in Section 4.3.Based on these results it is concluded that the element is not effective when compared with the HSM and DKT elements.

As in the Kirchhoff plate theory, the state of stress in the plate is defined with plane stress assumption, i.e. uz= 0,and with the assumption of plane anisotropy (no coupling between u b and y ) .

The variables Ub and V, represent the bending and transverse shear contributions, respectively, and k in equation (11) contains shear correction factors to account for the non-uniformity of the transverse shear stresses through the plate thickness. f In equations (8) and (9) the matrices Db and D, are functions o the thickness of the plate, h, and of the elastic properties of the different layers; the variable A is the area of the middle f surface of the plate.

The expression of U as given by equations (7)-(9), or (13) and (14), is used to formulate finite elements for the analysis of thick plates, moderately thick plates, sandwich plates and multilayered plates where the transverse shear effects are important. The independent quantities 3 subjected to variation are w,Px and By with the conditions that w = 1 , PX= pxand 0 , = &, on the part of the boundary where displacements are prescribed. The C ocontinuity requirements are not difficult to fulfil and various elements can be developed. In thin plate analysis, selective reduced integration has been employed for low-order (see Section 3.3). It is interestin to note that with high-order elements neither reduced nor selective integration is required. 8 1 7

1779

The finite element model based on the functional in equations (7)-(9), or (13)and (14), must be able to represent this constraint. Therefore, the stiffness matrix of the DKT element for the analysis of thin plates is based only on the expression

where A is the middle surface of an element and K and Db are given by (3) and (lo), or (12a), respectively. Equation (17) contains only the first derivatives of BX and By and hence it is relatively easy to establish interpolation functions that satisfy the compatibility requirements. However, since PI, By are the variables in equation (17), it is necessary to relate the rotations of the normal to the middle surface to the transverse displacement w (which does not appear in equation (17)). This goal should be achieved with the following considerations: (a) The triangular element must have only 9 dof; that is, the displacement w and the rotations 0, and 8, at the three corner nodes. (b) Since the Kirchhoff solution of thin plates is sought, the nodal point rotations should be 8, = + w, and OY = - w,, (so that the Kirchhoff kinematical boundary conditions be satisfied). (c) Since the element models thin plates, as governed by the Kirchhoff plate theory, the Kirchhoff plate theory assumptions can be imposed at any discrete points. (d) The compatibility of the rotations PI and By should not be lost. The formulation of the DKT element as presented in References (33)-(36) is based on the following assumptions: (1) Px and P, vary quadratically over the element, i.e.

It is appropriate here to make the following remarks before continuing with the derivation o f the stiffness matrix.
(1) From the relations in equations (18)-(22) it is seer. that the relation between the rotations and the transverse displacement w is given by equation (20) by assuming a cubic variation of w along the sides (or a quadratic variation of w , ~ ) . (2) There is no need to define an interpolation function for w on the element (but the assumption of a cubic variation of w along the sides is the property of a cubic polynomial on the element). (3) Since w varies cubically along the sides, w , varies quadratically and so does p,. Since w , ~ ~ matches & at the three points along each side, the Kirchhoff hypothesis ( y s= & + w , = 0) is ~ satisfied along the entire boundary aA (Figure 4).

The procedure used here to define H-â is found to be valid and very effective for a general Db matrix. The technique is similar to that used in Reference 9. The only difference is that in Reference 9, area co-ordinates are used instead of the x and y co-ordinates, equations (40)-(42). The result is that in Reference 9 the A matrix is simpler in form than equation (50); however, the G matrix, as introduced in the discussion below, is more difficult to formulate. This is due to the different nature of the generalized parameters f3 in both approaches. The second important step in the formulation of the stiffness matrix is the evaluation of the integral on dA = 12+23+31. On side i j (ij= 12, or 23, or 31) we have

(67) Once the nodal displacements are known, the bending moments are evaluated using equations (40) (66): and (68) Note that different bending moments are obtained along the interelement boundaries since the p's are different for different elements.

3.3. The selective reduced integration element (SRI)
The formulation of the SRI element is based on the theory of plates with transverse shear deformations included (see Section 3.1.1)and follows the approach given in References 42 and 54. The main difficulty in the development o selectively integrated elements is to obtain an f accurate and reliable element. The issue of reliability is most important in actual practical analysis,58and we would only want to use an element that does not contain spurious zero energy modes. The basic displacement assumptions for the SRI element are the deformations w, Px and Py which vary linearly over the element:

where Li = 1 - 6 - 7, = 6,LJ = 7 and wi, fix, and By,,i = 1,2,3, the nine nodal values at the Lz are ) corner nodes (Figure 1 . Using equations (7),(14) and (18) stiffness matrix of the SRI element is defined as the

In equation (70) Kb is a matrix with constant terms (exact integration), and K, is a matrix f involving integrals o quadratic terms in 5. 7 . If exact integration is used, convergence towards the thick plate solution is obtained but the rate of convergence is low. Considering the analysis of thin plates the concept of reduced integration can be e r n p l ~ y e d by~evaluating the ~ â~ shear stiffness K, using only one numerical integration point (which is equivalent to assuming that y is constant over the element). This element has been tested and the numerical results obtained in the analysis of some problems that are given in Section 4.3. These results show that the element is not effective in the analysis of thin plates. In addition, the element also contains spurious zero energy modes, which would have to be eliminated before the element could be recommended for general practical analysis. As established in recent s t ~ d i e sin certain~cases the stiffness matrix associated with a ~~â~ selective integration formulation is equivalent to the stiffness matrix obtained using a mixed formulation of the Hellinger-Reissner type, where the dof associated with the stresses are considered as internal (element) parameters. If this equivalence can be shown, it provides further insight into the formulation of the element. For the present triangular element we show this equivalence in Appendix C. 4. IMPLEMENTATION AND NUMERICAL RESULTS The DKT, HSM and SRI plate bending elements have been implemented in the computer program ADINA.49 Several sample problems have been solved using these elements and the results have been compared with those obtained using other elements. 4.1. Remarks on the implementation of the elements The calculation of the DKT and SRI elements is similar to that of the two-dimensional isoparametric plane-stress element (evaluation of B matrix and integration of BTDbB, Reference 11).In the case of the HSM element, the matrices H-â G are first evaluated. The and stiffness matrix is then obtained using equation (67). Considering the loading on the elements, a uniform loading is represented by lumped concentrated loads acting at the nodes, i.e. the element load vector corresponding to a uniform pressure load 4 per unit middle surface is fT=A/3[y 0 0 q
0 0 q 0 01 (75)

The bending moments are evaluated using equations (32) and (68) for the DKT and HSM elements, respectively. In ADINA, the moments can be evaluated at a maximum of seven f points: the centroid, the three corner nodes and the three mid-side nodes o each element. In dynamic analysis, a diagonal lumped mass matrix is employed. Neglecting the inertia effects at the rotational dot, the vector of the diagonal elements of the mass matrix is given in equation (75) with p instead of q, where p is the mass density per unit area. The techniques and strategies used to evaluate the natural frequencies are those of the ADINA program.49 A study of the formulations given in Section 3 shows that comparable storage and operations f are needed to form the stiffness matrix of the HSM element compared to that o the DKT element. This is also true for the evaluation of the stresses in the elements. 4.2. Analysis of sample problems using the DKT and HSM elements Several sample problems were analysed using both the DKT and HSM elements. The element performances were evaluated and compared with those of other 9 dof elements.

The analysis results of different static and free vibration problems are described in the following sections. Some of the results presented have been reported already by other authors, e.g. References 19,33,36 and 59 for the DKT element, and References 26,27 and 28 for the HSM element. 4.2.1. Square plate under concentrated and uniform loads with clamped and simply-supported edges. In this analysis, a square plate of sides 2a with either simply-supported or clamped edges is considered. Owing to symmetry in the problem, only one-quarter of the plate is modelled. The plate and the two different mesh orientations (A and B) used in the analysis are illustrated in Figure 5 . Four different sizes of meshes are considered: 2 , 8 , 3 2 and 128 triangular elements are

used to form the meshes corresponding to N = 1, 2 , 4 and 8, respectively. For the case of the concentrated load (P), different sizes of meshes in both A and B orientations are employed the while only mesh orientation A is considered for the case of the uniform pressure loading ((I). In all cases, the simply-supported as well as the clamped boundary conditions are considered. As shown in Figure 5, both the DKT and HSM elements are evaluated with other established elements, namely the BCIZ1, BCIZ2, HCT, A-9 and STRUDL elements. The central deflections and moments of the DKT and HSM elements for all the above cases are given in f f Reference 53. The comparisons o the predicted results with those o other elements are given in Figures 6-15. Some remarks on the results are given in the following:

(1) Considering first the case o the concentrated load application, Figures 6 and 7show that the f DKT and HSM elements are very efficient. Note that mesh B is not effective in modelling the clamped plate problem, since all dofs of the comer element vanish. The influence of mesh orientation on the displacements is more severe for the DKT element than for the HSM element. Convergence from above is obtained for the DKT element, whereas monotonic convergence from below is observed for the HSM element. (2) 'Inthe case of uniform loading, monotonic convergence was achieved with the DKTelement s f with both boundary conditions. However, convergence i less rapid in the case o the clamped plate. The solution accuracy could probably be increased by employing a consistent load representation with a cubic polynomial for w. Monotonic convergence is not achieved in the analysis of the clamped plate using the HSM element.

(3) In general, the stresses obtained with the HSM element meshes are slightly better than those with the DKT elements for the same problem (see Figures 10-15, and Tables 4-7 of Reference 53). Similarly, the boundary conditions in terms o stresses such as M, = O along a simplyf supported side are slightly better satisfied with the HSM elements. However, the difference between two distinct values of moments at a node connecting two elements is not smaller with the HSM elements.
4.2.2. Twisting ofa square plate. This study is intended to evaluate the twisting behaviour of the DKT and HSM elements. Particular attention is given to the DKT element as the twisting are not equal in general, equation (3). This problem can, curvatures due to Bx.v and therefore, be used to evaluate the ability of the DKT element to represent stresses due to a constant twist (a patch test problem). The same problem has been considered in References 16 and 21 using other finite elements.

The square plate is simply supported (i.e. w = 0) at the corners A, B and D as shown in Figure 16. A vertical load is applied at corner C. The exact thin plate solution with the data given in = Figure 16is M, = M y 0 and M x y= 2.5 lb-in/in everywhere in the plate with w, = 0.2496 in and w o = 0.0624 in. Four different meshes are considered: meshes (a) and (b) are regular with 2 and 4 elements, respectively; meshes (c) and (d) are irregular with 4 and 8 elements, respectively. The results obtained using both the DKT and HSM elements are excellent. All four meshes with either element give the exact solution for stresses and displacements (stresses are evaluated at the centroid as well as at the corner nodes). These results are compared in Figure 16 with those given in Reference 16. The ACM (a 12 dof incompatible rectangular element) and the HCT

results were obtained with a regular fine mesh of 8 x 8 elements. Considering the results given in Reference 21, the A-9 and the non-conforming BCIZl elements do reproduce the exact stresses with mesh (a), and the BCIZl element cannot predict the exact solution even with very fine meshes if the mesh subdivision is irregular. (A 30 per cent error in the stresses exists at the centroid for mesh (d).)

4.2.4. Free vibration analysis of a square plate with clamped and simply-supported edges. The natural frequencies and mode shapes of simply-supported and clamped square plates are evaluated using the DKT and HSM elements and a lumped diagonal mass matrix. Two uniform mesh orientations (mesh A and B, Figure 5 ) are used with N = 1,2,4,8. Only doubly-symmetric modes were calculated by considering one-quarter of the plate (ABCD in Figure 5). The first six eigenvalues (and associated modes) are given in Tables I and 11. The modes are described by the number of half-waves m and n parallel to the x and y axes, respectively: ( 1 , l ) corresponds to the fundamental mode with no nodal line within the plate. The non-dirncnsional where eigenvalue is A = p ~ ~ [ ( 2 a ) ~ ] / D ,p is the mass density per unit mid-surface and w the angular frequency. For the simply-supported plate the exact successive eigenvalues are given by

the expression A = ( m 2 + n 2 )2 7r 4 . For the clamped plate the reference solution is taken from Reference 50. A comparison of the results for the first eigenvalue using different models is given in Table 111. The calculated values using the DKT and HSM models (meshes A and B and a lumped diagonal mass matrix) are compared with those reported in Reference 19 using the DKT and the HCT elements with the same meshes but using a consistent mass matrix. The convergence characteristics of the DKT and HSM elements (with a lumped diagonal matrix) are compared in Figure 18 for both types of boundary conditions and meshes. Considering the analysis results, we make the following observations. (1) For the simply-supported plate, modes (1,3) and ( 3 , l ) (or (1,5) and ( 5 1 ) ) (see Table I) are theoretically associated with the same eigenvalue. The finite element results are different for these modes, but the differences between the values decrease as the mesh is refined and in every case both values converge to the reference value. (The nodal line of one of the first two modes is circular and the other nodal line is along the diagonal of the plate.) Similar observations also hold for the clamped plate and have been discussed previously using other finite element

mass dof are illustrated in Figure 20, together with experimental results. Considering the results we make the following observations. (1) The DKT and HSM elements predict the fundamental frequency accurately. However, the higher frequencies are calculated less accurately. (2) The 21 mass dof models predict the higher frequencies more accurately than the 10 mass dof ones. However, considering the fundamental frequency, the larger dof models give values that are further away from the experimental result. This numerical prediction can be explained by the fact that the finite element solution converges to the Kirchhoff plate theory result, which deviates from the experimental one due to assumptions and experimental errors. (3) The first three mode shapes are represented accurately by the DKT element. Qualitative representation is still retained in the higher modes.

4.3. Results of some sample static problems using the SRI element

The standard square isotropic plate ( v = 0.3, = 2) was analysed to test the behaviour of the k simple triangular element based on the reduced integration technique. The concentrated load condition was considered and mesh A(N = 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12) was used (Figure 5 ) for the clamped plate and the simply-supported plate. The solution results are given in Tables V and VI for different values of side to thickness ratios ( 2 a l h ) .These results show that considering a thick plate the element converges to the thick plate solution (see, for example, Reference 60); however, the element cannot be employed satisfactorily for the analysis of thin plates. The selective or reduced integration technique when applied to two-node beam and fournode quadrilateral elements gives good results in the analysis of some problems of thin beams and plates for aspect ratios up to l o 4 (References 42 and 57).However, considering the present

triangular element, the behaviour of the SRI element was not found acceptable for the two standard tests; hence, no other problems were considered using this element.

CONCLUSIONS
In this study, the discrete Kirchhoff theory (DKT) and hybrid stress model (HSM) elements have been found to be the most effective 9 dof triangular elements available for bending analysis of thin plates. Both elements can be formulated and implemented very efficiently. Their effectiveness has been observed in a variety of static and dynamic analyses. Based on theoretical and computational considerations and the numerical results, the DKT element is found to be somewhat superior to the HSM element. Because of little storage requirements, these two elements appear to be very promising for structural analysis on mini- and micro-computers. A
