Abstract A ﬁnite element parametric modeling method of aircraft wing structures is proposed in this paper because of time-consuming characteristics of ﬁnite element analysis pre-processing. The main research is positioned during the preliminary design phase of aircraft structures. A knowledgedriven system of fast ﬁnite element modeling is built. Based on this method, employing a template parametric technique, knowledge including design methods, rules, and expert experience in the process of modeling is encapsulated and a ﬁnite element model is established automatically, which greatly improves the speed, accuracy, and standardization degree of modeling. Skeleton model, geometric mesh model, and ﬁnite element model including ﬁnite element mesh and property data are established on parametric description and automatic update. The outcomes of research show that the method settles a series of problems of parameter association and model update in the process of ﬁnite element modeling which establishes a key technical basis for ﬁnite element parametric analysis and optimization design.

and practical value that can improve product quality and performance, reduce production costs, shorten design cycle, and so on.1 FE modeling is data pre-processing for FE analysis. The calculation accuracy of the FE method depends on the degree of approximation of physical characteristics of the model and its real structure. Therefore, establishing a correct and reasonable FE model is the most important issue to carry out FE analysis and optimization. However, there is an encountered problem that a signiﬁcant amount of time and workforce is required for creation and modiﬁcation of the FE model. In addition, it is one of the major difﬁculties in application of the FE method. Therefore, high-quality and automated FE modeling has been an important direction of research on aircraft structural FE technique.2

A ﬁnite element parametric modeling technique of aircraft wing structures

Fig. 1 Process of ﬁnite element modeling of aircraft wing structure.

The current process of FE modeling of aircraft wing structures is shown in Fig. 1. Firstly, geometric model is generated by the CATIA system manually, and then imported in PATRAN. Secondly, FE meshing and property loading are usually completed via manual software operations. Therefore, as most operations of FE modeling are interactive, design quality and results rely heavily on technical level and experience of designers while lack effective means of digital design knowledge and experience accumulated in the design process. In addition, because of the complexity of wing structure, the interactive approach is difﬁcult to meet the demand for rapid modeling during design. Aircraft structure design is also an iterative process. A new round of adjustment of the structure layout and repeated meshing and ﬁnite element property loading are needed in each iteration. A method of ﬁnite element parametric modeling is proposed in this paper. The layout of wing structure, geometric mesh model, and FE model including ﬁnite element mesh and property data are established on parametric description and automatic update. The generation processes of skeleton model, geometric mesh model, and FE model of wing structure are achieved based on CAD parametric technology. The method settles a series of problems of geometric model description, parameter association, and model automatic update in the process of FE modeling which establishes a key technical basis for parametric FE analysis and optimization. Work in this paper is positioned in the preliminary design phase of an aircraft structure. After rapid FE modeling completion, the deﬁnition of the aircraft structural preliminary design is formed, and the ﬁnal FE analysis model and the optimized size parameters of the main components can be output. 2. Knowledge-based template parametric technique Template can be considered as a technique similar to knowledge reuse in view of case reasoning, which is based on thing similarity and multiplexing principle of design methods.3 The basic idea is that template extracted from a class of analogous things and any similar things can be deemed as a template. The

core of template is reuse of design information and parametric variations. Internal components of aircraft wing are not greatly different in spite of numerous parts, such as wing and horizontal tail. Some of them are composed by skins, spars, ribs, and stringers, especially for a high aspect ratio wing used on no matter an airliner or a UAV. Although structural dimension and the number of components are usually different, they have almost the same function, layout, and generation process of components. Therefore, the components of aircraft wings have a strong template feature. Computer-aided techniques have been used extensively in the process of aircraft design, but application modes of computer-aided design and analysis software emphasize results rather than process. Results are static, and the process of results of acquisition and change requires a large number of manual operations, which leads to much workload in design, modeling, analysis, and change, and largely affects efﬁciency of the structural design process. In fact, any process of design or analysis includes a number of rules and methods. Although the objects manipulated by software tools may be different, these rules and methods are invariable. They can be generalized and encapsulated in a template. Design and analysis are carried out through the template, which may achieve knowledge-driven modular design. The process is shown in Fig. 2. All templates in this paper are developed by using Microsoft Visual Basic and script language VBS. The script records the procedure of geometric modeling and data processing. The operation can repeat automatically without manual intervention when the script replayed. A same type but completely different model can be generated if different parameters are given to the script. After determining design parameters and constraint parameters, the script ﬁle of actual models is produced in the sample script ﬁle, and then a speciﬁc geometric model is driven to be generated by corresponding software. A template can be abstracted as a function: y ¼ fðxÞ ð1Þ

where x is the input parameters including design parameters and constraint parameters. Design parameters of the template are used to change the characteristics of the model and constraint parameters are mainly applied to restrict and control relationships between various models. y is the output parameter, which is usually a geometric or an analytical model. There are not only rules, but also initial data, intermediate data, as well as ﬁnal data within a template. Therefore, a template can also be considered as a way to describe design objects and design process. Compared with traditional methods of design object descriptions of ﬁnal results, a template not only contains ﬁnal results of design objects, but also includes the process of design object generation. The greatest advantages of this approach are repeatability, traceability, and variability of a design object.

1204 In the process of FE modeling, a variety of templates in design are associated with coupling organically caused by data stream formed among templates. Thus, when the input parameters of upstream design change, all relevant aspects of downstream design automatically adjust to match this change. 3. Parametric layout of wing structure Structural design of an aircraft wing requires a layout of spars, ribs, and stringers based on the reference plane of the wing and generation of a skeleton model of wing structure. Skeleton model, the backbone of the model design, is an assembly design model with multi-rank abstract levels, signiﬁed with geometric elements of points, lines, surfaces, and all kinds of benchmarks in CATIA. Skeleton model includes station planes, axes, web surfaces, and other structure layout information of components. 3.1. Structural layout deﬁnition The simplest possible parametric coordinate system is used for the purpose of specifying positions of wing structural components.4 This coordinate system is shown in Fig. 3. The parametric coordinates are as follows: c is the chordwise coordinate (0 at the leading edge (LE), 1 at the trailing edge (TE)); s the spanwise coordinate (0 at the root, 1 at the tip); z the thickness coordinate (+1 at the airfoil top surface, À1 at the airfoil bottom surface). All position references for structural components must be linked to this parametric coordinate system or speciﬁed relatively to other structural components.5,6 Thus, the positions and orientations must be stated in one of the following manners: (1) Parametric coordinate positions P(c, s, z). (2) Positions relative to other structural elements (e.g., ribs parallel aircraft symmetry axis). (3) Orientations relative to durable parametric geometric references (e.g., parallel or perpendicular to a speciﬁc % chord line). (4) Orientations relative to other structural elements (e.g., parallel or perpendicular to a speciﬁc component).

J. Tang et al. 3.2. The process description of component creation The geometric characteristics of wing structure is determined by the region boundary deﬁnition and the internal layout characteristics of the structure is usually determined by positions and other parameters of the components such as spars, ribs, and stringers.7 The internal components and the layout manner of wing structure can be deﬁned as the following forms: <structure layout>::=(<spar>, <rib>, [stringer], {<station plane>, <axis>, [web surface]}) <layout manner of spar>::=(<in proportion>) <layout manners of rib>::=(<parallel aircraft symmetry axis>, <parallel a certain rib station plane>, <perpendicular to spar>) <layout manners of stringer>::=(<in proportion>, <parallel spar station plane>, <parallel a certain stringer station plane>) The wing structure layout can be generated based on the reference plane (z = 0). Structural parameters of the components are deﬁned and the process of the components creation is as follows8,9: (1) Spar is assumed to be continuous from the top airfoil surface to the bottom airfoil surface. (a) The start, section point, and end position of a spar are speciﬁed in terms of the parametric coordinates P(c, s) and the connecting line of all points is the axis of the spar. (b) Determine station plane based on the axis and reference plane. (c) Station plane and the top or bottom airfoil surface intersect separately, and then the intersection area is ﬁlled to generate a web surface of the spar. (2) Rib is also assumed to be continuous from the top airfoil surface to the bottom airfoil surface. (a) Position is often deﬁned by a spar or a certain rib. The rib station plane is always parallel to the aircraft symmetric axis at the junction of the fuselage and the rest are mostly perpendicular to the front or rear spar axis, or selected parallel to a certain rib station. (b) Station plane and the top or bottom airfoil surface intersect separately, and then the intersection area is ﬁlled to generate a web surface of the rib. (c) Determine the start and end positions of a web surface of the rib. (3) Stringer is virtually identical to a spar except for a ﬂag specifying whether the stringer is on the top or bottom surface of the airfoil. (a) The start and end positions of a stringer are speciﬁed in terms of the parametric coordinates P(c, s) or the station plane of a certain spar. The connecting line of all points is the axis of a stringer. (b) Determine station plane based on the axis and reference plane. (c) Station plane and the top or bottom airfoil surface intersect separately to generate top and bottom airfoil surface stringers.

3.3. Deﬁnition rules of component name Deﬁnition rules of component name are usually decided by designers, but they will directly affect efﬁciency and quality of skeleton model creation. When all types of IDs increase with the complexity of a model, unreasonable name rules may cause confusion in the process of modeling. In skeleton model, component information including axis, plane, and serial number of segmented components must be identiﬁed. Name rules require speciﬁcation and certain regulation. Each individual component corresponds to a name. Element name deﬁnition rules are as follows: Component ID + element type + serial number of segmented component (1) Component ID is the name of a component (e.g., front spar, 2#rib, or top airfoil surface stringer). Multiple elements share a component ID for segmented components. (2) When a variety of elements describe a component (one section of a spar is described as axis, plane, and the coordinate system), the identity must be distinguished by element type. If a rear spar is divided into two sections, the ﬁrst section of the axis is named rear axis 1 and the ﬁrst section of the station plane is named rear station plane 1. (3) When a component is divided into many sections, it must distinguish the identity with the section serial number such as rear spar axis 1 and rear spar axis 2. Each geometric element must be unique in skeleton model to ensure the formation of an associated model system. Therefore, in the same CATPart ﬁle, geometric elements cannot have the same name. If other models cite the elements of skeleton model, model numbers and element names must be cited simultaneously to ensure uniqueness. 3.4. Automated generation of skeleton model The template parametric technique is used in the process of skeleton model generation. Knowledge including design methods, deﬁnition rules, and experiences used by designers in the process of modeling is encapsulated in a template. Program drives CATIA to complete skeleton model generation automatically. In the process of design, based on parameterization of wing structure, the layout of new or similar parts can be carried out through data replacements and parameter modiﬁcations with the same template. Fig. 4 is the template of parametric modeling of skeleton model of horizontal wing structure. Before running the template, users need to pick up several upstream planes or surfaces of wing structure and input information of the components in the template interface. Parametric modeling of spars, ribs, and stringers are rapidly completed in ﬁve minutes for wingbox and less time for horizontal tail and other horizontal wing structures except for active wing parts. Skeleton model of a wingbox generated by the template as an example is shown in Fig. 5. The upper airfoil surface is hidden for clearer demonstration.

4. Parametric design of geometric mesh model Geometric mesh model as a discrete form of skeleton model is in an important status in FE modeling. A connection is established between skeleton model and FE model.10 Based on geometric mesh model, properties of each element can be individually deﬁned and viewed as optimization variables and check objects in the FE analysis and optimization. Compatibility is required for FE mesh of an aircraft wing structure.11 If two components cross, on the line of the intersection, in order to ensure that the right combination of adjacent curved surface patches mesh in combinatorial surfaces, it is necessary to guarantee the same discrete form on common boundary and FE mesh to be completely consistent. On the line of the intersection, that is to say, nodes of the FE mesh of two components must be coincident. Therefore, in order to set up an FE model, starting from the untrimmed geometry, skeleton model produced by the structural design department needs mesh discretization. The purpose of mesh discretization is to convert topological relations to constraint relations of common edges and points of the components in the skeleton model. A wing structure is

1206 always a mesh element model constituted of components. There are various segmentation lines on skins and webs, such as spar or rib caps and stringers. These curves and boundary lines of surfaces divide the surfaces into small surfaces called geometric mesh elements. All these small surfaces cannot be divided. If two components cross and the line is l, the vertexes and edges of the geometric mesh elements of the two components overlap completely on the line. Designers generally have to perform quite a lot of manual work before a model geometry being ready for meshing. In particular, designers need to cut the surfaces of all model components along their intersections in order to produce sets of surfaces that are suitable for meshing, such as surface segments with no more than four edges and each edge matching with one and only one edge of the adjacent surface segments.12 Fig. 6 shows two examples of which one model has been properly segmented and the other has problems. 4.1. Geometric mesh model element generation process and algorithm Geometric mesh model of an aircraft wing structure includes two types of elements: one-dimensional and two-dimensional elements.13 The generation process and algorithm of geometric mesh model elements are described as follows: Step 1 Suppose M is a set of geometric surfaces of skeleton model. Given a geometric curve surface F, according to the topological relationship of the components in skeleton model, SL = {L1,L2,. . .,Lk}, the set of lines of intersections is obtained when M and F intersect. Step 2 Suppose a set of all top and bottom airfoil surface stringers on the geometric curve surface P is

J. Tang et al. ST = {S1,S2, . . .,Sm}. Combine SL and ST to form a set union SHL = {L1,L2,. . .,Lk+m}. Step 3 Based on the intersection algorithm of curves, all the internal points of intersections are generated. Cut all curves in SHL with these points and get a curve segments set SLG, which is the set of one-dimensional elements of wing structure. Step 4 SLG is able to encircle a closed loop and the elements consisting of the closed loop are two-dimensional mesh elements. Solve all of the corresponding mesh elements, completing the generation of two-dimensional geometric mesh elements of aircraft wing structure.

4.2. Automatic generation of geometric mesh model The process of skeleton model segmentation is well known to be time expensive and often trivial. Besides, every time a change occurs in skeleton model topology, the segmentation process has to be performed again. However, until the entire model surfaces are properly segmented, the automatic meshing functionalities provided by most of the FE preprocessors cannot be used. Nevertheless, the segmentation process features some of favorable characteristics that make it a good candidate for KBE (knowledge-based engineering) applications: lengthy, repetitive, and plenty of geometric manipulations based on logic mechanisms. In fact, designers apply a set of mental rules and practices when manually performing the segmentation process. Based on knowledge engineering in this paper, rules and specialist experience are encapsulated in a template. Geometric mesh model is generated which is driven by program rapidly. The model produced by the template is shown in Fig. 7. Geometric mesh model is the premise and basis of FE meshing. It has a great impact on the quality of the following FE mesh. 5. Generation and description method of FE model FE model comprises FE mesh and properties including physical properties and material properties.14 It contains all geometric and topological information of geometric mesh model. Meshing is conducted in geometric mesh model elements to ensure that the adjacent element mesh is consistent exactly on the common boundary. Properties of the components are stored in geometric mesh model, and element properties in FE model inherit directly from geometric mesh model. Every time that a reconstruction of FE model is needed, the mesh

A ﬁnite element parametric modeling technique of aircraft wing structures properties update, so that the corresponding element properties in FE model are always correct when the geometry changes. Methods of traditional analysis and optimization design are based on FE model. Therefore, the descriptions of geometric characteristics and physical properties of the structure are applied on FE model. This approach has obvious limitations during applications because the physical description is based on FE model, on which topological relations cannot be changed in the calculation process. However, for the structural analysis problem with a practical engineering background, most of the physical properties of FE model are associated with the structure of a hierarchical topology of geometric elements directly or indirectly. The method of FE modeling in this paper is based on geometric model. In the process of modeling, the deﬁnition and generation of FE model are established on geometric model. The following three problems need to be solved: (1) FE property data deﬁnition. (2) Automatic FE meshes generation. (3) Automatic FE property loading.

5.1. FE property deﬁnition The rules of aircraft wing structure property deﬁnition are described as follows: <properties>::=(<structure types>, <element types>, <material properties>, <physical properties>. . .) <structure types>::=(<plate element>, <rod element>, <beam element>, <shell element>. . .) <element types>::=(<CROD>, <CQUAD4>, <CBAR>, <SHEAR>. . .) <material properties>::=(<Aluminum alloy>, <Titanium alloy>, <Magnesium alloy>, <Alloy steel >, <Composite materials>. . .) <physical properties>::=(<thickness>, <sectional area>, <coordinate>. . .) Selection of elements is very important. Appropriate element can reduce computational time and improve computational efﬁciency. A bad choice may affect the calculation results, such as the different results obtained from the selection of beam or rod elements. According to the different mechanical characteristics of wing components, FE model elements can be selected by the following principles: Spar cap, rib cap, and stringer which bear the axial force caused by the wing bending moment should be simpliﬁed as rod elements, namely one-dimensional elements. Spar web, rib web, and skin which bear shear loads and bending loads should be simpliﬁed as shell elements, namely two-dimensional elements. The types of elements used for each component are shown in Fig. 8. 5.2. Automatic mesh generation Geometric mesh is regarded as the basic element in FE meshing to ensure that meshes of adjacent elements are consistent exactly on the common boundary, which can transfer the con-

nection relation of the components in geometric mesh model to FE model, achieving automatic conversion from geometric mesh model to FE model. The theory of FE meshing has been very mature.15–17 In this paper, mesh seeds are arranged on the edge of two-dimensional elements depending on the size of seed distance to control the accuracy of a mesh, which can guarantee uniform distribution and coordination of the mesh. Meshing module controlled parameters of mesh size, and FE mesh elements are generated automatically by the meshing program based on different aircraft wing structural characteristics as well as the line and surface numbers. High-quality quadrilateral elements are chosen in most of the regions and triangular elements are employed in the local transition zone, as illustrated in Figs. 8 and 9. Due to the different layouts of wing structure components, a triangular area always appears at the lap between rib and rib as shown in Fig. 9. The triangle area on the skin is composed by trapezoidal and triangular discrete elements. When a triangular discrete element is smaller, it can be treated solely as an FE mesh element. If the triangular area is larger, separate divisions are usually needed. Taking into account the complexity of FE meshing, methods and rules are summarized and encapsulated in a template during manually performing the mesh division. The template of FE model generation is shown in Fig. 10. Pick up geometric mesh model and input the mesh reference size in the interface, and then run the template. Program is implemented automatically and FE model is generated rapidly.

The research of this paper is applicable for aircraft structural design. CATIA is the most important tool for structural engineers and it is the most familiar environment for them. Therefore, the template is developed and encapsulated by Visual Basic language based on the CATIA environment, while the process of meshing is performed by PATRAN through secondary development language PCL. 5.3. Automatic FE property loading The substance of FE property loading is to integrate the components of geometric mesh model and the properties of a cross-section which has been created. Geometric mesh model is a geometric object surrounded by spars, ribs, and stringers, only with geometric information. It becomes a structural element with speciﬁc mechanical properties after integrating components and particular cross-sections. It possesses materials, cross-sectional types, sizes, and other information in addition to geometric information. The process of FE modeling, analysis, and optimization of an aircraft wing structure is iterative18, as shown in Fig. 11. According to different needs of updating geometric model and FE model in the process of optimization iterations, size optimization and shape optimization are very different. Size optimization is conducted on the initial FE model of the structure. In the process of optimization iterations, the modiﬁcation of design variables will not inﬂuence the model and only need to update physical properties of the structure without adjusting station parameters, as shown in Fig. 11. Shape optimization, however, is entirely different. The optimization problem is built on geometric model of the structure. Geometric model and FE model update at the same time in the process of optimization iterations, causing a new round of meshing and repeated property loading. The common feature of size optimization and shape optimization is that FE properties need to be updated after optimization. Property loading always wastes time and energy, and thus automatic loading becomes an important way in FE modeling. FE model consists of a number of rod and shell elements, while each element also includes element number, node, and other information. The nodes and elements are output from

the geometric mesh model shown in Fig. 7 and deﬁned by certain rules. The form is letters added with digits that PATRAN can distinguish. These data can be deﬁned by an object-oriented way and managed by a linked list. Fig. 12 gives the information management of FE model of wing structure and the logical relationship between relevant information through a linked list. Each geometric mesh element or ﬁnite element, in the light of MSC.Nastran format requirement, has a property card, through which the property of the element is speciﬁed. Different elements correspond with different generation logics: (1) For shell elements, the properties of thickness and material can be deﬁned directly in the program. (2) For rod elements, material property can be obtained from the interface as shown in Fig. 13. Only aluminum

A ﬁnite element parametric modeling technique of aircraft wing structures 6. Conclusions

1209

A method of ﬁnite element parametric modeling of aircraft wing structures is proposed in this paper. It settles many problems of interactive operations and improves the speed of modeling. A knowledge-based template parametric technique is studied, achieving accumulation and reuse of knowledge in design. Because a template encapsulates engineers’ experience, designers, even beginners, only need to input parameters in the interface. A complex modeling process can be executed automatically by the program, which reduces the difﬁculty of design and ensures the quality of design at the same time. The contributions of the methods and the template technique of this paper are concluded as follows: (1) Rapid generation of skeleton model through the template encapsulated methods and rules in design improves the speed of modeling. Design parameters can also be changed according to optimization results in the template interface to achieve fast modiﬁcations of the model. (2) Considering operation characteristics in the process of geometric mesh segmentation, template is employed. The components are divided automatically and geometric mesh model is generated rapidly. (3) Automatic meshing of aircraft wing structure is accomplished based on CATIA, without any operations in PATRAN, reducing the task difﬁculty of structural engineers. (4) FE properties are loaded on the components of wing structure automatically. The problem of numerous manual interactive operations is solved efﬁciently in the process of FE pre-processing.

alloy, titanium alloy, and a certain composite material are provided to be chosen. Physical property mainly refers to area property which could be obtained by the technology of UDF. The process of area acquisition of rod elements can be described as follows: (a) Build a sketch of wing components’ section and conduct constraints on the parameters of distance and angle. Publish relevant parameters of the sectional sketch to generate UDFs of the components. (b) Create a UDF library of different geometric crosssectional shapes of the components. (c) Instantiate UDFs of the components. Sectional types of all components are set previously in the program and sectional parameters are identical to the size values in UDFs. If modiﬁcation is needed, sectional types and parameters can be selected and modiﬁed in the template interface, as shown in Fig. 13. (d) Obtain the accurate sectional areas of components by CATIA own measurement means and the process of area acquisition is shown in Fig. 12. Then the measured cross-sectional areas are given to rod elements.

After acquisition of element properties, designers can run the instruction directly and the corresponding bdf ﬁle will be automatically generated, achieving property integration and automatic loading of FE model. Management and applications can be viewed through PATRAN. This manner of property loading reduces workload of modeling greatly and improves design quality and efﬁciency, and thus plays a signiﬁcant role in aircraft preliminary design.
