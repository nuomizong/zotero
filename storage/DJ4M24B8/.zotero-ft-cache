In this paper a general solution to the geometrically nonlinear dynamic analysis of plates stiffened by arbitrarily placed parallel beams of arbitrary doubly symmetric cross-section, subjected to dynamic loading, is presented. The plate-beam structure is assumed to undergo moderate large deflections and the nonlinear analysis is carried out by retaining nonlinear terms in the kinematical relations. According to the proposed model, the arbitrarily placed parallel stiffening beams are isolated from the plate by sections in the lower outer surface of the plate, making the hypothesis that the plate and the beams can slip in all directions of the connection without separation and taking into account the arising tractions in all directions at the fictitious interfaces. These tractions are integrated with respect to each half of the interface width resulting in two interface lines, along which the loading of the beams and the additional loading of the plate are defined. Six boundary value problems are formulated and solved using the analog equation method (AEM), a BEM-based method. Both free and forced transverse vibrations are considered and numerical examples with great practical interest are presented demonstrating the effectiveness, wherever possible, the accuracy, and the range of applications of the proposed method.

1. Introduction
Stiffened plate panels are structural elements of practical importance in applications such as ship superstructures, bridge decks, and aircraft structures. Stiffening of the plate provides the benefit of added load-carrying capability with a relatively small additional weight penalty, while buckling is prevented especially in case of inplane loading. The unique peculiarities of the aforementioned structures are obtained due to the behavior of the bond between the plate and the beams; however, this bond is the usual reason why these structures are prone to failure. Moreover, since these stiffened plates are frequently subjected to dynamic loading such as air blasts or underwater explosions, a clear understanding of the dynamic response requires development of an efficient dynamic analysis capability. When the deflections of the structure are small, a wide range of linear analysis tools, such as modal analysis, can be used and some analytical results are possible. As the

deflections become larger, the induced geometric nonlinearities result in effects that are not observed in linear systems, making therefore the determination of an analytical solution extremely difficult and in most cases impossible. Moreover, having in mind the importance of weight saving in engineering structures, the study of nonlinear effects in the analysis (large deflection analysis) of stiffened plates becomes essential. These nonlinearities result from retaining the squares of the slopes in the strain-displacement relations (intermediate nonlinear theory), avoiding in this way the inaccuracies arising from a linear or a linearized secondorder analysis. The linear dynamic behavior of stiffened plates has been widely studied employing the Rayleigh-Ritz method [1â4], the transfer matrix method [5], the finite difference method [6â9], the finite element method [10â12], the finite strip method [13], and the boundary element method (BEM) [14â16]. To the authorsâ knowledge, a limited amount of technical literature is also available on the nonlinear dynamic

2 analysis of stiffened plate systems. According to this, the integral equation method has been applied for the large deflection analysis of clamped laterally loaded skew plates with stiffener parallel to the skew directions [17]. Moreover, the finite element method has been widely used for the free large-amplitude flexural vibration of stiffened [18] and laminated plates [19, 20] and for forced vibrations under instantaneous loading taking into account both geometric and material nonlinearities [21]. The spline finite strip method has also been applied for the examination of nonlinear transient vibration of stiffened plates [22] and the Galerkin method has been employed for the solution of discrete equations derived after the application of Fourier series for the deflection of the plate [23, 24]. Nevertheless, in all of the aforementioned research efforts restrictions are encountered, arising from the ignorance of the tractions in the fictitious plate-beams interfaces, of the nonuniform distribution of the interface transverse shear force, or of the nonuniform torsional response of the beams. The behavior of composite slab-and-beam structure is affected significantly by the deformability of the shear connection. Therefore, much research effort has been done concerning the linear dynamic analysis of composite beams with deformable connections. Wu et al examined the free vibration of partial interaction composite beams with axial force and proposed an approximate simple expression to predict the fundamental frequency of the partial-interaction composite members with axial force [26]. Xu and Wu investigated the static, dynamic, and buckling behavior of partial-interaction composite members by taking into account the influences of rotary inertia and shear deformations [27]. Moreover, they also employed the state-space method in order to develop an exact two-dimensional plane stress model of composite beams with interlayer slips [28, 29]. On the other hand, less research effort has been made on the forced vibration of partial-interaction composite beams. Girhammar and Pan [30] investigated the dynamic behavior of partial-interaction composite beams without axial force and presented the orthogonality relation of vibration modes. They also obtained the analytical expressions for the transient response of composite beams under impulsive and step loads. Adam et al. [31] decomposed the dynamic response into two parts, the quasi-static component solved by integrating the influence function and the complementary component solved by the mode superposition. Recently, Girhammar et al. [32] employed Hamiltonâs principle to derive the governing equations for dynamic problems of composite beams under generalized boundary conditions. At the same time, they studied the forced vibration of composite beams by virtue of mode superposition. However, in the literature, large deflection analysis of partial interaction has received limited attention and focused especially on the static behavior of the structure [33â38]. In this paper, a general solution to the geometrically nonlinear dynamic analysis of plates stiffened by arbitrarily placed parallel beams of arbitrary doubly symmetric crosssection with deformable connections subjected to arbitrary dynamic loading is presented. The solution is based on the structural model proposed by Sapountzakis and Mokos in

Advances in Civil Engineering [39] and Dourakopoulos and Sapountzakis in [40], according to which the stiffening beams are isolated from the plate by sections in the lower outer surface of the plate, making the hypothesis that the plate and the beams can slip in all directions of the connection without separation (i.e., uplift is neglected) and taking into account the arising tractions in all directions at the fictitious interfaces. Due to the slip, relative inplane displacements between beam and plate arise, assuming however that they are continuously in contact and taking into account the arising tractions in all directions at the fictitious interfaces. These tractions are integrated with respect to each half of the interface width resulting in two interface lines, along which the loading of the beams and the additional loading of the plate are defined. The unknown distribution of the aforementioned integrated tractions is established by applying continuity conditions in all directions at the two interface lines taking into account their relationship with the interface slip through the shear connector stiffness. Any distribution of connectors in each direction of the interfaces can be handled. The utilization of two interface lines for each beam enables the nonuniform torsional response of the beams to be taken into account as the angle of twist is indirectly equated with the corresponding plate slope. Six boundary value problems are formulated and solved using the analog equation method (AEM) [41], a BEMbased method. The essential features and novel aspects of the present formulation are summarized as follows. (i) The adopted model permits the evaluation of the inplane shear forces (longitudinal and transverse) at the interfaces in both directions, taking into account the influence of interface slip, the knowledge of which is very important in the design of shear connectors in plate-beam structures. (ii) Utilization of two interface lines permits the nonuniform distribution of the inplane forces along the interface width to be taken into account. (iii) Both free and forced transverse vibrations are considered taking into account geometric nonlinearities. (iv) The stiffened plate is of arbitrary shape and is subjected to arbitrary dynamic loading, while both the number and the placement of the parallel beams are also arbitrary (eccentric beams are included). (v) The cross-section of the stiffening beams is an arbitrary doubly symmetric thin or thick-walled one. The formulation does not stand on the assumption of a thin-walled structure according to which torsional and warping rigidities can be evaluated employing closed-form expressions without significant error as long as the cross-section thickness is small [42]. Therefore, in this paper, the cross-sectionâs torsional and warping rigidities are evaluated âexactlyâ in a numerical sense employing the BEM (requiring only boundary discretization for the cross-sectional analysis). (vi) The plate and the beams are supported by the most general boundary conditions including elastic support or restraint.

(vii) The nonuniform torsion in which the stiffening beams are subjected is taken into account by solving the corresponding problem and by comprehending the arising twisting and warping in the corresponding displacement continuity conditions. The distributed warping moment arising from the nonuniform distribution of longitudinal inplane forces is also taken into account. (viii) Contrary to previous research efforts where the numerical analysis is based on BEM using a lumped mass assumption model after evaluating the flexibility matrix at the mass nodal points, in this work, a distributed mass model is employed. Based on the numerical solution developed, several examples with great practical interest are presented, demonstrating the effectiveness, wherever possible, the accuracy, and the range of applications of the proposed method.

2. Statement of the Problem
Let us consider a thin plate of homogeneous, isotropic, and linearly elastic material with modulus of elasticity ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ , volume mass density ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ , shear modulus ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ , and Poissonâs ratio ]ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ having constant thickness âï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and occupying the two-dimensional multiple connected region Î© of the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ plane bounded by the piecewise Îï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 0, 1, 2, . . . , ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) boundary curves. The plate is stiffened by a set of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 1, 2, . . . , ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ arbitrarily placed parallel beams of arbitrary doubly symmetric cross-section of area ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and length ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ . The material of the beams is considered to be homogeneous, isotropic, and ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ linearly elastic with modulus of elasticity ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ , mass density ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ,

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ shear modulus ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ , and Poissonâs ratio ]ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ . Therefore, material nonlinearities are not considered in the following analysis. For the sake of convenience the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ axis is taken parallel to the beams of length ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ which may have either internal or boundary point supports. The stiffened plate is subjected to the arbitrary lateral dynamic load ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½(x, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½), x : {ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½}, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ â¥ 0. Owing to this loading, the plate and the beams can slip in all directions of the connection without separation (i.e., uplift is neglected). For the analysis of the aforementioned problem, a global coordinate system ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ for the analysis of the plate and local coordinate ones ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ corresponding to the centroid axes of each beam are employed (Figure 1). The solution of the problem at hand is approached employing the improved model proposed by Sapountzakis and Mokos in [39] and Dourakopoulos and Sapountzakis in [40]. According to this model, the stiffening beams are isolated from the plate by sections in its lower outer surface, taking into account the arising tractions at the fictitious interfaces (Figure 2). Integration of these tractions along each half of the width of the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½th beam results in line forces per unit length in all directions in two interface lines, which are ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ denoted by ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ , ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ , and ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 1, 2), encountering in this way the nonuniform distribution of the interface transverse ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ shear forces ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ , which in previous models [43] was ignored. The aforementioned integrated tractions result in the loading of the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½th beam and the additional loading of the plate. Their distribution is unknown and can be established by imposing displacement continuity conditions in all directions along the two interface lines, enabling in this way the nonuniform torsional response of the beams to be taken into account. Thus, the arising additional loading (Figure 3) at the middle surface of the plate and the loading along the centroid axis

with respect to the the primary warping function shear center of the beam cross-section (coinciding with its centroid) at the point of the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½th interface line of the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½th plate-beam interface. On the basis of the above considerations the response of the plate and the beams may be described by the following boundary value problems. (a) For the Plate. The analysis of the plate is based on the Von KÂ´rmÂ´n plate theory, according to which the deflection a a of the plate cannot be regarded as small as compared to the plate thickness, while it remains small in comparison with the rest dimensions of the plate. Due to this assumption, geometrical nonlinearities should be taken into account and the displacement field of an arbitrary point of the plate, as implied by the Kirchhoff hypothesis, is given as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) = ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) â ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Vï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) = Vï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) â ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ , , (1a) (1b) (1c)

The boundary conditions (18)â(21b) are the most general boundary conditions for the beam problem including also the elastic support. It is apparent that all types of the conventional boundary conditions (clamped, simply supported, free, or guided edge) can be derived from these equations by specifying appropriately the aforementioned coefficients. Equations (7a)â(17d) constitute a set of seven coupled and nonlinear partial differential equations including thirteen ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ unknowns, namely ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ , Vï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ , ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ , ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ , Vï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ , ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ , ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ , ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½1 , ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½1 , ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½1 , ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½2 , ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½2 , and ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½2 .

Taking into account the displacement fields expressed by (1a)â(1c) and (12a)â(12e) the displacement continuity conditions [47] can be expressed as follows. In the direction of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ local axis: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½1 â ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ âï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½1

In all of the aforementioned equations the values of the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ primary warping function ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ , ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ) should be set having the appropriate algebraic sign corresponding to the local beam axes.

3. Integral Representations-Numerical Solution
The solution of the presented dynamic problem requires the integration of the set of (7a)â(7c) and (17a)â(17d) subjected to the prescribed boundary and initial conditions. Moreover, the displacement continuity conditions should also be fulfilled. Due to the nonlinear and coupling character of the equations of motion, an analytical solution is out of question. Therefore, a numerical solution is derived employing the analog equation method [41], a BEM-based method. Contrary to previous research efforts where the numerical analysis is based on BEM using a lumped mass assumption model after evaluating the flexibility matrix at the mass nodal points [15], in this work, a distributed mass model is employed. In the following sections, the plate and beam problems represented by (7a)â(7c) and (17a)â(17d), respectively, are examined independently and the connection between these problems is achieved employing the displacement continuity conditions. 3.1. For the Plate Displacement Components ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ , Vï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ , ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ . According to the precedent analysis, the large deflection analysis of the plate becomes equivalent to establishing the inplane displacement components ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and Vï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ having continuous partial derivatives up to the second order with respect to ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, and the deflection ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ having continuous partial derivatives up to the fourth order with respect to ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, and all displacement components having derivatives up to the second order with respect to ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. Moreover, these displacement components must satisfy the boundary value problem described by the nonlinear and coupled governing differential equations of equilibrium (equations (7a)â(7c)) inside the domain, the conditions (equations (8a)â(8e)) at the boundary Î and the initial conditions (equations (9a)-(9b)). Equations (7a)â(7c) and (8a)â(8e) are solved using the analog

4. Numerical Examples
On the basis of the analytical and numerical procedures presented in the previous sections, a FORTRAN program has been written and representative examples have been studied to demonstrate the effectiveness, wherever possible, the accuracy, and the range of applications of the proposed method. It is noted that the term âlinear analysisâ appearing in all of the following sections refers to the solution of the previously obtained system of equations neglecting all of the nonlinear terms. Example 1. A rectangular plate (âï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 0.2 cm, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 3 Ã 107 kN/m2 , ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 2.5 tn/m3 , ]ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = ]ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 0.2) with dimensions ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Ã ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 18 cm Ã 9 cm subjected to a suddenly applied uniform load ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 50 kN/m2 and stiffened by a rectangular beam of 0.5 cm height and 1.0 cm width, eccentrically placed with respect to the plate center line (Figure 4), has been studied. The plate is clamped along its small edges, while the rest of the edges are free according to the transverse and inplane boundary conditions.

The connection between the slab and the beam is accomplished using a linear distribution of shear connectors along each interface. The adopted relationship for the shear connectorsâ stiffness is given as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 250ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ â ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ kN/m2 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 2 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (45) ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 1, 2) , where ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ is a dimensionless magnification factor. In Table 2 the obtained maximum deflections ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ of the first cycle of motion of the stiffened plate, at the middle of the free edge A, are shown for various values of the factor ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, performing

either a linear or a nonlinear analysis. In Figure 5 the time histories of the deflection ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) at the middle point A of the free edge of the examined stiffened plate, for the case of full connection between the plate and the beam, taking into account or ignoring geometrical nonlinearities, are presented as compared with those obtained from FEM solutions employing 8-noded hexahedral solid finite elements [25]. Moreover, in Figure 6 the contour lines of the deflection ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ of the stiffened plate (full connection) at the time of maximum transverse displacement are presented as compared with those obtained from the aforementioned FEM solutions, ignoring (Figures 6(a) and 6(b)) or taking into account (Figures 6(c) and 6(d)) geometrical nonlinearities. In order to demonstrate the influence of the shear connectors in the dynamic behaviour of the stiffened plate, in Figure 7, the time histories of the deflection ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) at the same point A are presented, for various values of the factor ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, performing either a linear or a nonlinear analysis. In Figure 8 the contour lines of the deflections ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ of the stiffened plate at the time of maximum displacement are presented, for various cases of connectorsâ stiffness, ignoring (Figures 8(a), 8(c), and 8(e)) or taking into account (Figures 8(b), 8(d), and 8(f)) geometrical nonlinearities. Moreover, in Figure 9, the contour lines of

20 the displacements ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ , Vï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ of the stiffened plate at the time of maximum deflection ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ are presented employing nonlinear dynamic analysis. Example 2. The linear and nonlinear response of a rectangular plate having a central stiffener, as shown in Figure 10, has been studied (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 68.9 GPa, V = 0.30, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 2.67 tn/m3 ). The plate is subjected to a suddenly applied uniform load of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 300 kPa, while its boundaries are simply supported with restraint against inplane motion. In Figure 11 the linear and nonlinear time history response of the deflection of the half panel center A is depicted. In this figure the obtained results are compared with those presented by Jiang and Olson [53] employing conventional finite strip method, by Koko [54] employing super finite element method, and by Sheikh and Mukhopadhyay [22] employing the spline finite strip method. As it can easily be observed, there is significant agreement between the results concerning the linear dynamic analysis while deviation between the different types of analysis is observed in nonlinear dynamic analysis, which has been already mentioned by the previous investigators [22, 53, 54]. Example 3. A rectangular plate with dimensions ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Ã ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 1.8 m Ã 0.9 m (Figure 12) stiffened by an ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ cross-section beam (Figure 13) eccentrically placed with respect to the plate centre line, clamped along all its edges, and subjected to a suddenly applied uniform load ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 750 kN/m2 has been studied (âï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 0.02 m, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 68.9 Ã 106 kN/m2 , ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 2.67 tn/m3 , ]ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = ]ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 0.3). In Table 3, the torsion ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and warping ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ constants of the beam cross-section and the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ values of the primary warping function (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ )ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ = 1, 2) at the nodes of the two interface lines are presented. In Figure 14 the time histories of the maximum deflection ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) of the plate for the cases of linear and nonlinear dynamic analysis are presented as compared with those obtained from FEM solutions using 8-noded hexahedral solid finite elements [25]. Moreover, in Figure 15, the contour lines of the displacement ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ of the stiffened plate at the time of maximum transverse displacement are presented as compared with those obtained from the aforementioned FEM solutions, ignoring (Figures 15(a) and 15(b)) or taking into account (Figures 15(c) and 15(d)) geometrical nonlinearities. The convergence of the results between the two methods is noteworthy. Finally, in Figure 16, the contour lines of the corresponded moments ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ , ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ at the time of maximum transverse displacement are presented. Taking into account the aforementioned convergence of the results between the two methods (AEM, FEM), the importance of the reduction of calculation time when employing the proposed method should be highlighted. More specifically, for the determination of the beamâs response to the dynamic loading, a personal computer of 8 Gb RAM and Intel I7 processor of 4 cores with maximum clock speed equal to 3.8 GHz was used. The time step used for the nonlinear analysis is 1 microsecond (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½sec) and for a full circle response the calculation time employing the proposed method was

Advances in Civil Engineering 20 minutes as compared with FEM analysis which lasted 50 minutes.

5. Concluding Remarks
A general solution for the geometrically nonlinear dynamic analysis of plates stiffened by arbitrarily placed parallel beams of arbitrary doubly symmetric cross-section subjected to arbitrary loading is presented. The proposed model takes into account the nonuniform distribution of the interface shear forces and the nonuniform torsional response of the beams. The main conclusions that can be drawn from this investigation are as follows. (a) The proposed model permits the dynamic response of stiffened plates subjected to arbitrary loading, while both the number and the placement of the parallel beams are also arbitrary (eccentric beams are included). The plate and the beams are supported by the most general boundary conditions including elastic support or restraint. (b) The adopted model permits the evaluation of the longitudinal and transverse inplane shear forces at the interfaces between the plate and the beams in the geometrically nonlinear analysis of the stiffened plate, the knowledge of which is very important in the design of shear connectors in stiffened structures. (c) The nonuniform torsion in which the stiffening beams are subjected is taken into account by solving the corresponding problem and by comprehending the arising twisting and warping in the corresponding displacement continuity conditions. The distributed warping moment arising from the nonuniform distribution of longitudinal inplane forces is also taken into account. (d) The accuracy of the results and the validity of the proposed model are noteworthy. (e) The influence of geometrical nonlinearity on the deformation of the examined stiffened plates is remarkable. In the case of immovable inplane boundary conditions, the displacements decrement can be verified. (f) The increment of the deflection with the decrement of the connectorsâ stiffness is easily verified, while this decrement results in a more pronounced influence of the geometrical nonlinearity on the response of the stiffened plate. (g) The developed procedure retains most of the advantages of a BEM solution over a FEM approach, although it requires domain discretization.
