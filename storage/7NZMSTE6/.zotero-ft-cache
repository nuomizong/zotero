ABSTRACT

This report deals with the analysis of plates and stiffened plates in the elastic and elastic-plastic range using the finite element stiffness approach. The analysis is based on the

classical theory of thin plates exhibiting small deformations. A short description of the finite element techniques in use to date, and a review of some existing plate bending elements are presented. A refined rectangular plate bending element based

on a higher order polynomial expression is then derived and a systematic procedure for the derivation of its stiffness matrix is outlined. The accuracy and convergence of solutions obtained with

this new element are demonstrated on a few example structures showing that the new element compares favorably with presently known plate elements. Chapter 3 deals with the analysis of stiffened plate structures in the linear elastic range. The derivation of the

component stiffness matrices is carried out first,and the assemblage of the system stiffness matrix is described. The outlined

general approach is then applied

extensively to highway girder

bridges,and the versatility and accuracy of the method are demonstrated. In Chapter 4, a general procedure for the analysis of elastic-plastic plates is presented. A description of the mathe-

matical model, consisting of a plate element subdivided into a

finite member of layers is given,and the associated incremental elastic-plastic solution technique is outlined. A few example

solutions show the accuracy and versatility of the proposed tangent stiffness approach. Finally, in Chapter 5, a general procedure for the elastic-plastic analysis of stiffened plate structures is presented. The layered plate model used in the elastic-plastic anal-

ysis of plates is supplemented by a similar layered beam element for this analysis,and the associated step-by-step iteration technique used to solve the linearizedgoverning equations is

described. All presented types of analyses have been implemented with the essential aid of a high speed digital computer (CDC 6400) and examples of application prove their validity and versatility.

INTRODUCTION

1.1

Objective and Scope Plates of various shapes are commonly used as structural

systems or structural components.

Most frequently, plates form

part of floor systems in buildings or bridges,and are often used in connection with beams and columns. Generally, there is ample

room for a variation in geometry, thickness and loading, as illustrated in Fig. 1 and hence, the analysis of such complex structures often presents considerable difficulties. Stiffened plates of arbitrary shape are complex and highly redundant structures, the analysis of which is beyond the scope of currently used methods of analysis. Plates are often

used in combination with beams and columns in floor systems of buildings and bridges,and in these cases,are predominantly loaded by forces acting perpendicular to the plate surface. In buildings,

many different floor layouts are possible; consequently, there is virtually no restriction placed as far as geometry of the stiffened plate structure is concerned. The in-plane loading (if any)

applied to such structures can often be neglected, thus simplifying the analysis considerably. This investigation is limited to the
I

problem of analyzing transversely loaded stiffened plates; i.e. no in-plane loading is considered. However, due to the fact that

the beams are eccentrically attached to the plate, in-plane deformation must be considered. To date, the analysis of beam-slab type

-1-

structures still constitutes a challenge to the structural engineer because no fully satisfactory method of analysis is available. It is widely accepted that a structure should be properly analyzed for working loads,as well as at its failure stage. By

means of an elastic analysis, one is able to determine the stresses and deformations, occurring under working loads, at selected points of a structure. If the determined stresses are kept below allow-

able stresses, then experience shows that a structure is not likely to fail. An accurate elastic analysis is also needed for considera-

tions of fatigue and control of cracking in reinforced and prestressed concrete structures; i.e. stresses must be kept below certain levels in order to avoid fatigue or excessive cracking. Although the fatigue strength of reinforced or prestressed concrete structures is difficult to establish,and reliable criteria for crack control have not been established, an accurate elastic analysis is the prerequisite for establishing such guidelines. On the other hand, an elastic analysis cannot predict the response of a structure stressed beyond the elastic limit load, and up to its failure load. An analysis of the post-elastic range

is needed to predict eventual damages,and to determine the deformations occurring.during the application of overloads. No damage

is desired to occur under working loads,but at the same time it is required that a structure should be able to withstand a Â·certain overload. The strength of a structure of the type considered in

this investigation is needed to ascertain that failure should not

-2-

occur under working load, and hence, to design a structure with an adequate factor of safety. An attempt to analyze complex shaped

plate structures in the post-elastic range, as well as to predict the failure load, is developed in Chapter 4. Most engineering materials, such as steel, aluminum, and properly designed reinforced concrete are ductile, and can withstand strains much greater than the strain associated with the elastic limit state. As the structure is loaded beyond this state,

plastic straining occurs, causing a redistribution of stress in a redundant structure. The ductility in redundant structures per-

mits a redistribution of stresses beyond the elastic limit, allowing a structure to carry considerable additional loads. Thus, it

is felt today that a design should also consider the post-elastic behavior of a structure, as well as its ultimate strength. The

post-elastic response of a structure is of interest because it enables the designer to judge the effects of possible overloads. The knowledge of the load carrying capacity, or ultimate strength, of a structure is twofold: (l) it allows the determination of the

factor of safety of a structure against failure, and (2) the stress resultants resisted by the structural components at ultimate load are required to properly dimension each structural part. The goal of the reported study is the development of an approach which will allow the tracing of the entire load-deformation behavior of complex shaped stiffened plate structures, as well as

-3-

to find the ultimate load-carrying capacity of such structures. The application to the inelastic analysis of beam-slab type bridges will allow the study of the behavior of such bridges in the post-elastic range as well as at failure. It is obvious that due to

the current trend of increasing vehicular weight limits, the behavior of bridges above the elastic limitstage must be known in order to judge the effects of overloading. Current permit regu-

lationsâ¢are not based on a rational structural analysis of the bridge superstructure under the load level in question. Also,

there is no existing rational method to judge the effects of overloading of bridge superstructures. The continuous load-deformation

behavior of a stiffened plate structure stressed beyond its elastic limit is needed to judge the effects of overloading. At this

point it would be appropriate to note that the concept of Ultimate Strength Design, as outlined in the ACI Building Code (Ref. l), does not account for a redistribution of stresses due to redundancy of the structure. Recognizing that this redistribution actually

plays an important role in highly redundant structures, it is felt that modern bridge design philosophy should reflect the inelastic behavior. Within the framework of this report, only the numerical technique by which the elastic-plastic response of complex shaped stiffened plates can be obtained, is described. The application

of the developed technique to beam-slab type highway bridge superstructures of arbitrary material behavior is the subject of future research.

area considered is given Due to the practical im-

portance of plate structures,engineers have long been faced withthe task of analyzing plates of various geometry and loading. Unfortu-

nately, the governing differential equations are solvable only for simple geometry and boundary conditions, and as a consequence, many types of approximate analyses have been proposed to date. Extensive surveys of the state-of-the-art of current plate analysis are given by Timoshenko
(Ref~

3) and Girkman (Ref. 4) . method of

Probably the most commonly used approximate

analysis for solving plate problems of complex geometry is the method of finite differences. In this method, the governing dif-

ferential equation of equilibrium is satisfied only at selected points of the plate structure. The satisfaction of boundary c~nÂ­

ditions at boundary points of the plate leads to additional equations which, together with the original set of equations, must be solved simultaneously. These additional equations, however, de-

pend on the type of boundary and make it difficult to develop general purpose programs. During the last two decades much progress has been made in the development of structural methods of analysis based on matrix algebra and a discretization of the structure into an assembly of discrete structural elements. In these methods, a displacement or

-5-

a stress distribution is assumed within the element, and a complete solution is then obtained by combining these approximate displacement or stress distributions in a manner which satisfies the force-equilibrium and displacement-compatibility requirements at all interfaces of the elements. Methods based on such ap-

proaches have been proven to be suitable for the analysis of complex structures. This led to the development of the finite ele-

ment methods (Ref. 6), which are essentially generalizations of standard structural procedures as described in Reference 5, for example. To date, these methods have been successfully applied to Within the framework of the reported

study a refined finite element for plate bending is developed. This new plate bending element is presented in Chapter 2 of this report. To date, the elastic analysis of stiffened plate structures, as shown in Fig. 16, is performed in a more or less approximate manner. Though various types of methods are available, their

application to complex shaped beam-plate type structures is doubtful for other than simple geometry of the structure to be analyzed. Particular attention has been given in the past to the analysis of floor systems of highway girder brÂ·idges. Consequently, most meth-

ods were originally developed for bridge structures. In summary, it can be stated that as yet, no fully adequate analysis exists which is capable of determining stresses and deformations in complex shaped beam-slab type structures. Current

-6-

design methods are not completely rational, and are not based on a rigorous analysis, elastic or plastic (Ref. 2). Despite the fact

that designs performed to date have resulted in structures which perform successfully, it cannot be said with assurance that the designs resulting from such procedures are the best possible, or that different parts of the same structure have consistent factors of safety against the failure load, until better analytical methods are available. A survey of available methods of analysis, some of

which will be described, led to the conclusion that the finite element method, due to its great versatility, is best suited for the analysis of arbitrarily shaped stiffened plates, as shown in Fig. 16. This analysis is presented in Chapter 3. The analysis of the complete load-deformation behavior of complex shaped plates is mathematically difficult to accomplish. The inclusion of the non-linear material behavior in plate analysis results in partial differential equations which are amenable to analytic solution only for some very simple structures. As a con-

sequence, simplified methods designed to compute the ultimate strength of structures have been developed by a number of investigators (Refs 55, 56, 57). These methods are based on the theorems

of limit analysis, and allow the establishment of bounds on the collapse load. However, the prediction of the elastic-plastic

behavior of complex shaped plates cannot be accomplished using these methods. Using a numerical approach, a general method for

the analysis of elastic-plastic plates of complex shape is presented in Chapter 4.

Virtually no work has been done in the elastic-plastic analysis of stiffened plate structures. A general method which

enables the analysis of such inelastic structures is presented in Chapter 5.

2.1
Introduction The structural engineer is often faced with the analysis of complex shaped and loaded plates, as shown in Fig. 1. During

the last decade,the versatility of the finite element approach has been well demonstrated and a number of plate bending elements have been developed. While most of these elements lead to accurate

predictions for the displacement field, the internal moments computed are, in general, far less accurate. In this chapter, the development of a rectangular refined plate bending element is discussed. For the purpose of

establishing the notation used in this text and the connection w1th conventional plate analyses, a review of the basic equations governing the behavior of plates is first pres.ented. A short de-

scription of the finite element techniques in use to date is then given, followed by a review of some existing plate bending elements. The refined element, which is based on a higher order poly-

nomial displacement field, is then described,and the derivation of the element stiffness matrices is outlined. sistent load vectors are conditions is described.

assumptions of the classical theory of thin plates, a plate problem can be simplified into a two-dimensional elasticity problem. These assumptions can be stated as follows: 1. Plane sections normal to the middle surface before deformation remain plane and normal during deformation; also known as Kirchoff's assumption (Ref. 3). 2. The transverse displacement (w) is small in comparison to the thickness of the plate; i.e. w<<h. 3. Stresses normal to the plane of the plate are negligible.

The first two assumptions imply that (1) shearing stresses in the transverse direction are neglected, and (2) the deflection (w) at

any point of the plate is approximately equal to the deflection of the corresponding point located on the middle plane of the plate. The state of deformation can therefore be described in terms of

.-10-

the transverse displacement (w) alone.

Since the middle plane of

the plate is assumed to be free of in-plane deformation, in-plane behavior is not considered in this chapter. Making use of the

simplifying assumptions introduced above, the following relationships between in-plane displacements and the transverse displacement w exist:

Analysis of Plates Using the Finite Element Method 2.3.1 The Displacement Approach The finite element technique is a relatively new, but

very powerful,approach for the solution of engineering problems. The dominant reason for the extensive use of the finite element

technique in solving structural problems is its great versatility and complete generality. In fact, the same basic procedure can be

applied to structures of arbitrary shape, loading and boundary conditions. As a result, a single computer program can be used to

solve a variety of problems. The finite element concept, of which a comprehensive presentation is givenin Reference 6, was de~eloped by extending known matrix structural theories to two and three-dimensional solids. Argyris (Ref. 7) introduced the two fundamental methods of matrix structural analysis, the force and the displacement method of

-15-

analyses, in which a systematic approach to automatic computation of displacements and forces was first attempted. The work by

Turner et al. (Ref. 8), which may be interpreted as the first major step in the development of the finite element method, describes the direct stiffness approach. In this approach, in-

sight into the behavior of elements in representation of structures is achieved,and consideration is given directly to the condition of equilibrium and compatibility. However, in the treat-

ment of refined elements the physical behavior is obscured due to the more complex behavior of such elements. The first step in the displacement approach is to discretize a structure into a suitable number of finite elements. The behavior of the actual structure is assumed to be approximated by the behavior of the discretized structure; i.e. by an assemblage of finite elements having simple elastic properties and being connected so as to represent the actual continuum. For practical

reasons, the geometry of the elements must be simple, but generally could be of any shape. The elements are assumed to be inter-

connected at their nodal points,and the displacements of these nodal points constitute the basic unknown parameters of a problem. Displacement functions,often called shape functions, are then chosen for each element to uniquely define the state of deformation in Â·terms of nodal values, global coordinate system. which are referred to a

Elemental displacement fields should be

continuous (single-valued), and should satisfy deformation

-16-

continuity within the element and along element interfaces.

Conse-

quently, the entire displacement field of the discretized structure is continuous, piecewise differentiable, and in addition, is restrained to satisfy displacement boundary constraints. The dis-

placement field assumed for an element is called compatible if full continuity of deformation is achieved within the element, as well as along its boundaries. In this case, the chosen displace-

ment function uniquelydefines the state of strain within an element in terms of its nodal displacements. Hence, together with pos-

sible initial strains, these strains will define the state of stress
I

throughout the element,and on its boundaries. The loading acting upon the system is approximated by a set of equivalent concentrated nodal forces, again referred to a global coordinate system. These external forces should equili-

brate the internal boundary stresses, distributed loads and forces due to initial strains. This requirement leads to the relation-

ship between. generalized displacements and associated generalized forces. The matrix relating these two vectors is calledthe element Its elements are a function of the geometric

and elastic properties of the element. At this stage, a finite element solution follows standard structural procedures as described in detail in a number of references (e.g. Ref. 9). By appropriate superposition of the indi-

vidual element stiffness relations, the corresponding relationship for the entire structure can be established. In this process, the

-17-

~...:....

..

requirements of compatibility and equilibrium must be satisfied. Any system of displacements listed for_ the entire structure automatically satisfies all compatibility requirements. Establishing

equilibrium conditions at all nodes leads to the force-displacement relationship of the entire structure. For this purpose, the ele-

ment stiffness matrices, connecting nodal displacements to nodal forces must be transformed to a common coordinate system or reference frame. The formulation of the overall structural stiffness

matrix proceeds then by adding appropriate element stiffness contributions framing into a common node. system of linear algebraic equations. Finally, all kinematic restraints have to be imposed,and the resulting system of equations must be solved simultaneously for the unknown nodal displacements. Clearly, the satisfaction of This procedure leads to a

well-conditioned, sparsely populated, and narrowly banded if adequate nodal numbering of nodal points is provided. These pro-

perties permit an efficient,automatic assembly and solution of large systems of simultaneous equations. Once the solution of the

unknown displacements has been obtained, the determination of internal stresses,or stress
r~sultants,is

straightforward.

The

selection of displacement functions and the evaluation of the element stiffness matrix are the most important steps in the finite

-18-

element displacement approach and will be discussed in subsequent sections. Early derivations of finite element force-displacement relationships made no reference to variational considerations. Only recent developments have shown that these methods also have a solid theoretical foundation. The basic principles of linear

structural mechanics are the principle of minimum total potential energy and the principle of minimum complementary energy. These

variational methods form the basis for the derivation of element stiffness equations. The principle of minimum total potential

energy is stated as (Ref. 19): Of all compatible displacement fields satisfying given boundary conditions, those which satisfy also the equilibrium conditions make the total potential energy a stationary value.

equations shows that the finite element procedure is, in fact, identical with the Rayleigh-Ritz Approach. In the finite element method the assumed displacement functions are associated with individual elements only. The dis-

placements in the elements are uniquely defined in terms of the nodal p9int values,and the entire displacement field is assumed to consist of a_number of piecewise continuous displacement fields each extending over the region of an element. Clearly, the finite

element method, as well as the Ritz method, are approximate methods of analysis. However, if conforming elements are used, it can be

shown that if the mesh size is gradually decreased, the solution tends toward the true solution; i.e. convergence is assured for a valid minimum potential energy approach. One can also show for

this case that the strain energy is a lower bound, and the discretized structure is stiffer than the actual one if external loads are applied only. 2.3.2 Displacement Functions and Convergence Criteria One of the most important steps in the finite element displacement approach is the selection of displacement functions which discretize the displacement field o/ithin an element. These

assumed shape functions limit the infinite degrees of freedom of the system by expressing the deformation within a plate element in terms of displacement parameters at the nodal points. The accuracy

obtained depends on the extent to which the assumed deformation

-20-

pattern can approximate the true displacement pattern.

Generally,

finer meshes lead to a closer approximation,although convergence is not necessarily assured if the displacement functions are not properly chosen. So far, only limited attention has been given to the establishment of general rules for the selection of functional representations of element behavior. Recent research (Ref. 11) led to

requirements for the assumed displacement functions in order to arrive at a convergent finite element solution. As mentioned earlier, an approach based on a valid minimum potential energy solution assures monotonic convergence with decreasing mesh size. Melosh (Ref. 12) and Fraeijs de Veubeke

(Ref. 13) set out specific conditions under which a valid minimum potential energy approach is preserved in a finite element formulation. One of the basic requirements for generating deformation

consistent stiffness matrices is complete compatibility of displacement within the element and along its boundaries. Elements

derived from such displacement fields are called compatible. Melosh (Ref. 12) has shown that the selection of appropriate displacement fields can be accomplished by use of Langrangian or Hermitian interpolation techniques. The functions

are chosen such that they become dependent only on the displacements of the end points,and additional points along a side of the element in consideration. Bogner et al. (Ref.l4) used this ap-

proach to derive the stiffness matrix for a compatible rectangular plate element. -21-

Another general method for the selection of functions directly in terms of degrees of freedom is the spline interpolation concept. This approach was developed by Birkhoff (Ref. 15)

as a general mathematical procedure and employed by Pian (Ref. 16). A third approach used successfully in the functional representation of a displacement field is the concept of isoparametric element formulation. The shape functions chosen to des-

cribe the element boundaries are identical to those used to prescribe the variation of the displacement function. Ergatoudis

(Ref. 17) has pioneered this approach, and Zienkiewicz (Ref. 18) has applied it to generate stiffness matrices for different twoand three-dimensional elements. Often these interpolation concepts are difficult to apply; then a function is chosen, as outlined in Section 2.3.1, in terms of unknown nodal displacement parameters. These are

normally chosen equal in number to the number of degrees of freedom for the element in consideration,and can be evaluated from the enforcement of compatibility conditions at the element nodes. The choice of this function proved to be a major source of difficulty since an arbitrary choice may result in an unsatisfactory element displacement behavior,and as a consequence,may not lead to convergence. Thus, the question arises as to which require-

ments the assumed displacement function should satisfy in order that the associated finite element solution will converge toward the true solution as the mesh size is reduced. At present, the

-22-

\

view is held that the sufficient conditions for the derivation of deformation consistent stiffness matrices are as follows: 1. 2. Internal and interface compatibility must be satisfied. Displacement function must depend linearly on nodal parameters. 3. Proper representation of all rigid body displacement states is required. 4. 5. All.uniform states of strain must be included. The displacement field must be spatially isotropic. Requirement (1), as already discussed, leads to a valid minimum potential energy approach, and this, in turn, bounds the strain energy of the discretized structure. As a result, mono-

tonic behavior is obtained if the mesh is subdivided into elements of the same type so that all previous displacement states are contained in the new ones. This condition, as postulated by Melosh

(Ref. 12), is in fact a sufficient criteria for monotonic convergence. On the other hand, if all of the above given conditions

are met, with the exception of requirement (1), then numerical evidence has shown that satisfactory convergence can still be achieved; though it cannot be proved anymore via the principle of minimum total potential energy. Requirement (2) leads to the desired linear system of equations since linearly elastic material is assumed.

Requirement (3) is needed to include the conditions of global equilibrium. Self-straining would occur when the nodal Hence,

states could result in convergence toward

As the mesh size is decreased, nearly constant strain conditions will prevail in the element. If the condition is not met, 1 such

strain states could not be attained as the mesh size is reduced. Hence, it must be possible to represent constant curvatures in the case of pure plate bending. Conditions (3) and (4) are often re-

ferred to as completeness criterion. Furthermore, rigid body displacements are actually a particular case of the constant strain conditions, having zero values for strain. Requirement (5) insures that the resulting generalized force-displacement relations are independent of the position of the global coordinate system. Hence, the chosen displacement

functions must be independent of the particular shape of the element and the orientation of the element with respect to the coordinate system to which the functions are referred. Thus, attention

should be given to requirement (5) when truncated polynomials are used as displacement functions. Polynomial expressions have been used nearly exclusively

(

-24-

for the generation of different element stiffness matrices.

First,

this choice simplifies algebraic as well as automatic manipulations. Furthermore, polynomials satisfy the constant strain cri-

teria and simplify the investigation of compatibility requirements. Complete polynomials also satisfy the invariance criterion. A lower bound to the strain energy and monotonic convergence to the correct solution is obtained if conforming shape functions are used and the completeness criterion is satisfied. Oliveira (Ref. ll) proved that completeness and conformity are necessary but not sufficient criteria for convergence. According

to Oliveira, completeness is the only requirement which the displacement function must meet to arrive at a convergent finite element solution. However, completeness does not necessarily lead

to monotonic convergence. Considerable difficulty is experienced, in some cases, to find fully compatible displacement functions. Non-conforming

displacement functions will cause, in general, infinite strains at the element interfaces. Hence, only an approximation to the true

strain energy is found since,in calculating the energy as in the usual finite element approach, no consideration is given to the contributions to energy at the lines of discontinuity. However, if for finer mesh sizes the extent of the discontinuity tends to vanish, then an incompatible formulation will lead to the correct result. matrices Indeed, some finite element stiffness yield

excellent results.

2.3.3

Alternate Approaches Most of the finite element approaches developed to date

are based on the principle of minimum total potential energy, as described in Section 2.3.1. However, an alternate procedure is

possible if the functional to be minimized is the complementary energy of a system. The basis for such an approach is the

principle of minimum complementary energy, which can be stated as follows.(Ref. 19): Of all itatically admissible stress states, i.e. satisfying equations of equilibrium and all boundary conditions on stresses, those which also satisfy the compatibility equations make the total complementary energy a stationary value. value is a minimum.

Therefore, it is possible to arrive at an alternate finite element formulation if, in place of a compatible displacement field, an admissible stress field is taken to define strains, and hence the complementary energy. In this context,a stress field is called

conforming if it is in equilibrium within the element and balances all prescribed surface stresses. The stresses within the element

are assumed in terms of stress functions which in turn are

-26l.

expressed in terms of nodal parameters.

The principle of minimum

complementary energy is then applied to derive flexibility equations. Hence, the emphasis in this approach lies in the search

for conforming stress fields. Pioneered by DeVeubeke (Ref. 20), this approach is in general much more difficult since the search for equilibrium stress fields is more demanding than that of compatible displacement fields. It can be shown that this approach will give an upper

bound of the strain energy and thus overestimates the displacements. If both the compatible displacement approach and the approach based on the principle of minimum complementary energy are taken, valuable bounds to the true displacements are obtained. The prin-

ciple of minimum complementary energy has so far been applied to derive element stiffness matrices for simple elements in the elastic range. An extension of this formulation to arrive at flexi-

bility equations for more complex elements is difficult since conforming stress fields are difficult to establish. An extension

of this approach to elastic-plastic problems is not feasible since for a non-linear material behavior, the complementary energy does not provide for a reliable basis for the derivation of flexibility equations. Besides these two basic formulations, a number of alternate avenues can be taken to establish stiffness or flexibility equations. A comprehensive study of such approaches is given in

the survey by Pian and Tong (Ref. 21). For example, other functionals

-27-

could be selected, permitting the simultaneous variation of stresses and displacements together with assumptions made on both these quantities. Such approaches are called mixed formulations.

In these methods, generally neither equilibrium nor compatibility is fully satisfied,and for this reason,convergence must be proven for each particular case. 2.3.4 Existing Rectangular Plate Bending Elements During the last decade,much research effort has beenÂ· devoted to determine reliable element stiffness matrices for various shapes of plate bending finite elements. Attention has been

given to triangular, rectangular, and quadrilateral elements. Recent surveys of presently available triangular elements are given by Bell (Ref. 22) and Gallagher (Ref. 23). These surveys

show that a variety of fine performing triangular elements are available. Comparative studies have shown that rectangular elements show greater accuracy than triangular elements for the same number of degrees of freedom. In view of the refined rectangular

plate element developed in this report, a short review of some published rectangular and quadrilateral plate elements is given in this section. It should be stated that in the case of plate bend-

ing, continuity of displacement throughout the plate element implies continuity of deflection and slopes, i.e. first derivatives of the lateral displacement w. Thus, both the deflection and the

â¢

-28-

slopes must be continuous within the element and across its boundaries in order to fully satisfy the conditions of displacement compatibility. A survey of rectangular finite elements for plate bending is given by Clough and Tocher (Ref. 24). Various displacement

functions have been used to develop the stiffness matrix for a rectangular plate element. Within the framework of Kirchhoff 1 s

plate bâ¬nding theory, the deformations in a plate element are completely defined by the lateral deflection w. With this deflection

and two rotations unknown at each nodal point, a rectangular element, as shown in Fig. 4, possesses twelve degrees of freedom. One of the earliest functional representations for the deflection was suggested by Pappenfuss (Ref. 25):

It can be verified that this function satisfies interelement continuity of w, and the rigid body displacement modes are included. However, due to the absence of the term representing constant twist, the constant strain condition is not satisfied, and hence, convergence does not occur towards the correct solution. In another early paper, MeloshÂ· (Ref. 26) derived a different plate bending stiffness matrix, on the basis of physical reasoning. The simplest expression which has been used in deriving

'

-29-

DeVeubeke (Ref. 27) derived a compatible finite element by subdividing an arbitrary quadrilateral into four triangles and assuming a complete cubic polynomial displacement field within each triangle. Besides the four corner nodes, four midside nodes,

with one degree of freedom at each of those nodes,were defined. Clough and Felippa (Ref. 28) derived a compatible quadrilateral element having four corner nodes,only with three degrees of freedom each. It was built up from four triangles,and each of these triangles in turn consists of three subtriangles represented by a complete third order polynomial in w, the transverse displacement. Of all the elements discussed so far, the last three approaches show the best results. In most of the available litera-

ture, the convergence of an element is judged by plotting the accuracy of the solution against the number of subdivisions for a problem in consideration. A more appropriate comparison would be

to plot the accuracy versus the total number of degrees of freedom involved. Little work has been done to date in the derivation of stiffness matrices based on the alternate approach of minimizing the total complementary energy. Efforts to accomplish formulations

based on this functional or on ReissnerTs energy principle have been mainly concerned with the triangle. A number of mixed apIn a

undertaken by Severn and Taylor (Ref. 81) and generalized to the arbitrary quadrilateral by Allwood and Cernes (Ref. 30).

noted earlier,the deflection wand two slopes must be continuous for a plate bending problem. One can prove that,in this case,the

solution will converge monotonically towards the correct solution. On the other hand, formulations based on deflection functions not satisfying compatibility of normal slopes along interelement boundaries will not necessarily show monotonic convergence as the mesh size is decreased. It is the basic thought of the present investi-

gation that a refinement in element behavior can be achieved through the use of a higher order polynomial approximation of the displacement field. Consider the rectangular finite element, shown in Fig. 4, along with the introduced local coordinate system with its origin located at the centroid of the element. nents are assumed positive as shown.

The six degrees of freedom introduced at each nodal point lead to a 24-degree-of-freedom element, and permit the choice of a higher order polynomial for the approximation of the displacement field. Using this improved field, it should be possible to approximate the actual displacement field more closely, resulting in an improvement in the accuracy and convergence. The presence of curvature terms in the vector of unknown nodal parameters should also allow certain types of boundary conditions to be satisfied more properly than can be done in the usual displacement approach, having w and its slopes as unknowns. The continuity requirements imposed on the curvature

terms should especially improve the moment field since moments at all mesh points can be made continuous in this approach. Finally,

since the internal moments are obtained directly by summing the appropriate curvature terms, they need not be computed separately. The chosen polynomial can be conveniently represented by Pascal's triangle, as shown in Fig. 5. Twenty-eight free constants are

associated with this polynomial, i.e. one constant for each term. A completely conforming solution could be constructed by introducing additional nodes at each of the midsides of the rectangle and requiring that the normal slope be continuous at these points. Possessing the same number of known conditions as there are unknowns in this case, the interpolation problem could be solved uniquely. However, this approach is not taken here, since it

would result in different degrees of freedom for different nodal points, and hence, complicate the assembly of the system stiffness

In addition, it would increase the band width of the reIt would however, result in a

For the present approach, only twenty-four terms of the complete sixth-order polynomial are retained (the terms underlined in Pascal's triangle are omitted), since the deflection function for w can be defined in terms of these twenty-four parameters only. With geometric symmetry of the element, no preferential direction should exist. The terms with the highest even powers in x and y Despite It will be

seen later that the retention of inappropriate terms would result in a singular transformation matrix. Inspecting the chosen func-

tion, it is recognized that along any line of constant x or y coordinate, the displacement w varies as a fifth-order function. element boundaries, for example, are composed of such lines. fifth-order polynomial is uniquely defined by six constants. A The The

two end values of deflection, slopes, and curvatures at the end points will therefore uniquely define the displacement along these boundaries. As such values are common to adjacent elements, con-

tinuity of w will result along all interfaces. Furthermore, it can be seen that the gradient of w normal to any boundary varies as a fourth-order function. With only one

slope and curvature term imposed at each of the two end points of a boundary line, this function is not uniquely specified, and hence,

Derivation of Element Stiffness Matrices In this section, the element stiffness matrix for the

proposed refined element is generated.

The derivation is valid

for small strains and rotations; i.e. the linearized form of the strain-displacement equations is assumed to be valid. For the purpose of a plate analysis, it is simplest to define the curvatures as generalized strains. In order to

sent investigation the local coordinate system is always parallel to the global coordinate system, therefore the stiffness relations established need not be transformed. The formation of the com-

plete stiffness matrix for the discretized plate structure is finally accomplished by the direct addition of appropriate element stiffnesses at nodal points. 2.4.3 Kinematically Consistent Force Vectors Applied loads are usually distributed on structural elements. Equivalent concentrated forces, at the location and in the

direction of the global or reference coordinate system, are required for the analysis. In addition, concentrated forces may be

can be imposed by deleting appropriate rows and columns of the system. stiffness matrix. This constitutes a relatively cumber-

some and time consuming procedure for an automatic computation, though it results in a reduction of the total number of equations. This investigationuses a more convenient approach, proceeding with a direct solution of the original number of equations to avoid rearranging of rows and columns. In this approach, the

diagonal element of the system stiffness matrix, at the point concerned, is multiplied by a very large number. the At the same time

of the global force vector at the point concerned, is replaced by the same large number multiplied by the prescribed displacement value. The effect of these manipulations is to replace the origi-

nal equation by one which states that the displacement in question is equal to the specified displacement. This procedure of enforc-

ing boundary conditions is easily implemented in a general computer program, and all programs described in this report operate successfully, using this approach.

The deformed shape of a plate structure must be found in such a way that all boundary conditions adhering to a problem under consideration are satisfied. In a finite element displacement ap-

proach, such restraints can be at the selected nodal points only, since only the deformation components at the nodes are entered as field quantities. Boundary conditions in plate bending problems

usually include both the force (or static) and displacement (or kinematic) types. Only displacement type boundary conditions, i.e.

restraints which can be expressed in terms of displacement components, can usually be satisfied in a pure finite element displacement approach. However due to the fact that in the present approach the

three curvature terms are included in the final displacement vector, certain types of plate boundary conditions can be approximated more closely if the plate is made of isotropi6 or orthotropic material. Some common boundary conditions to be satisfied in a plate problem, along with the associated constraint equations, are listed in Fig. 6. The top half of the figure lists the boundary

conditions as introduced in conventional plate theory.

As derived

in Section 2.2.1, the internal moments are linear combinations of the curvatures of w. The introduction of the curvatures as nodal

parameters also makes it possible to exactly satisfy some static boundary conditions. If the boundary conditions of a simply supported plate are considered (Fig. 6) the classical theory of thin plates requires the following boundary conditions to be satisfied, at x

Therefore, the proposed approach allows all boundary conditions

associated with a simply supported edge to be satisfied exactly. This conclusion is only valid if no externally applied moments are acting along the boundary under consideration. Similarly, the boundary conditions associated with a clamped edge can also be satisfied exactly, as this can be done in the conventional displacement approach where only displacementtype boundary conditions are to be met.

The condition for zero vertical reaction at the free edge cannot be satisfied since in the present approach it is not possible to express this quantity in terms of nodal parameters. This is due to

the fact that no third order derivatives are listed in the vector of unknown nodal displacement components. The requirement of zero

normal moment could be satisfied exactly if,instead of the curvature

terms, their linear co1nbinations, i.e. internal moments, would be introduced in the displacement vector. a free However, since the case of

edge is relatively rare, no effort was made in this inves-

tigation to arrive at a more refined approach for satisfying this particular boundary condition. 2.4.5 Solution of the Stiffness Equations The displacement approach as described in Section 2.3.1,

efficient,automatic assembly and solution of large systems. The time required for the solution of the set of simultaneous equations is the single most important expense in solving large scale problems. Hence, the availability of an efficient

solution technique is of upmost importance in solving elastic,and especially elastic-plastic,problems. There are two fundamental groups of methods for solving linear algebraic equations, the methods of iteration or relaxation, and methods based on elimination. The main advantages of iterative

-51-

solution techniques are the relatively easy coding of such methods and the small amount of computer storage required. Solutions can

be obtained with reasonable computer time if the governing system of equations is well-conditioned. The latter requirement is not

always met and considerable difficulties may be experienced in solving large ill-conditioned systems. Though these methods can

be efficiently applied in the solution of linear elastic problems, their application in solving elastic-plastic problems is doubtful due to the fact that the initially elastic and diagonally dominant system can become ill-conditioned at latter stages following extensive plastic flow. At such a stage, the diagonal elements of

the stiffness matrix become small compared to the off-diagonal elements. For this reason, iterative or relaxation methods can In addi-

become inefficient in solving elastic-plastic problems.

tion, elastic-plastic procedures require the solution of the stiffness equations in incremental form if the complete load-deflection behavior of a structure is sought. Each step,in turn,requires an

iterative solution technique itself,and hence, the entire analysis would become too time-consuming. Furthermore, iterative methods

do not allow multiple load vectors to be processed simultaneously. This is a serious drawback in the elastic analysis of structures subjected to many different loading conditions. On the other hand, elimination methods do not require a well-conditioned system; only the number of equations to be solved and the bandwidth of the system are important. These methods do,

.

-52-

however, require larger amounts of computer storage.

The Choleski

decomposition method is among the most efficient and accurate elimination methods. This method was chosen as basis for the solution

of the resulting set of stiffness equations, for all the analyses presented in this report. The key to this method is the fact that

any symmetric square matrix can be expressed as the product of an upper and a lower triangular square matrix. Hence, it is possible

to decofllpose the symmetric and banded structure stiffness matrix [K] into the product of a triangular matrix [L] and its transpose [L]T, as shown in Fig. 7. This can be written as:
[ K]

= [ L]

[ L] T

(2. 48)

in which the terms L .. = 0 for i < j, and L .. T = 0 for i> j. Hence, lJ lJ the first step in this approach is to decompose matrix [K] into these two component matrices. It is observed that both of these

matrices are also of banded nature with a bandwidth which is equal to half the bandwidth of the system stiffness matrix. Considering

the special coordinate system introduced, the elements of [L] can be obtained by simple recursive relations. It is further noted

that in order to calculate column j of [LJ., only the elements in the shaded triangular area, as shown in Fig. 7, and the elements of column number j of the original matrix [l<] are required. The

fundamental stiffness equation, Eq. 2.43,can now be written in the form:
[ L] [ L] T ( 6 } = ( F}
(2. 49)

-53-

Introducing an auxiliary vector, defined as:
( Y}

= [ L] T

( 6}

(2. 50)

the stiffness equation can be written as
[ L] (Y}

= ( F}

(2. 51)

The solution of the original stiffness equation is accomplished in two ste~s: first vector (Y} is found by a forward sweep, and the

unknown vector (6} is finally determined by backward substitution of (Y} into Eq. 2.50. The fact that only a small part of the overall matrix is used at any time during processing is of considerable importance in the development of finite element programs capable of handling structures involving many thousands of degrees of freedom. In

order to save on core storage, the stiffness matrix is generated in blocks in the present approach,and the information is transferred to magnetic disc storage. The efficient use of the OVERLAY feature

and of magnetic discs allows large scale problems to be treated using relatively little computer storage. A subroutine, capable

of handling large banded systems of simultaneous equations was developed,based on the above described decomposition technique. The amount of information needed for processing at any time can be adjusted, and is called from discs accordingly. The analyzed examples show that the described direct elimination technique is very efficient and accurate. The fact

-54-

that multiple load vectors can be processed at the same time, allows complex structures to be analyzed for different loading conditions in a very efficient way. Provided the bandwidth is not

excessive, this method also proved to be very powerful for the elastic-plastic analysis of plates, as described in a subsequent section. It should be noted in this context that for a large bandwidth, the described method,which operates on all elements within the band, may require considerable computer time. Improved solu-

tion routines, processing non-zero elements or submatrices only, have been developed in recent years. Whetstone (Ref. 32) presented

recently a method which virtually eliminates both trivial arithmetic and wasted data storage space. Melosh (Ref. 33) describes a

solution algorithm based on the wavefront concept and a modified Gauss algorithm. According to these authors, such approaches can treat larger problems than bandwidth programs, involve negligible penalities,and at the same time,yield more accurate solutions than approaches using the Choleski algorith. However, such approaches

clearly involve years of intensive research, and hence, were not possible to accomplish within the framework of this investigation. 2.5 Examples of Solution 2.5.1 Selected Examples The following examples have been selected to illustrate

the application of the derived refined finite element, and to discuss its rate of convergence and accuracy. To simplify the com-

parison with analytic solutions, isotropic material is assumed and only simple examples are chosen. It should be noted here that the

general computer program developed is capable of handling plates of arbitrary geometry, as defined in Section 2.1, and orthotropic material can be treated. Four example problems, schematically represented in Fig.Â· 8, have been __ selected in this investigation. For all problems,

is apparent, as the convergence is fast and monotonic. Tables 6 through 9 list the computed internal moments M

meshes,the computed values for internal moments show good accuracy. Finally, Table 10 shows the internal twisting moment along a diagonal of the plate for the case of uniformly distributed load. From the results found, it is evident that excellent accuracy for displacements and internal moments is obtained with the refined plate element. In order to study the effect of the enforcement of boundary conditions, as discussed in Section 2.4.4, a number of comparisons have been made. For the purpose of these comparisons the fol-

lowing types of boundary conditions can be defined:

-58-

Type I:

Only displacement type boundary conditions associated with w, ow/ox and ow/oy are enforced.

Type II:

In addition to the constraints of Type I, curvature terms derived from a knowledge of the geometry of the deflected surface are enforced.

Type III:

In addition to the constraints of Type II, curvature terms derived from static considerations are enforced.

Tables 11 and 12 list, in part, the results of this investigation. In the conventional finite element displacement formulation, which is based on three degrees of freedom per node, i.e. on deflection w and its first derivatives, only boundary conditions of Type I can be satisfied. The present formulation also allows the enforcement of Comparing the computed

no difference can be recognized, thus leading to the conclusion that the imposition of additional curvature constraints does not improve the computed center deflection. As can be seen from Tables

13 and 14, in which results from this investigation for internal moments are compiled, the imposition of additional curvature terms does, however, improve the moment field, especially in the vicinity of the boundaries.

element in particular, using an auxiliary finite

element plate program. A direct comparison of the different finite elements used in the examples,in terms of mesh size,is not appropriate, since the computational effort is different for different elements and meshes. Most results available in the literature are listed

separately for each mesh, and hence Tables l, 2, and 3 were set up for reference only. In a finite element approach involving fine meshes, the

major part of the computer time required is used for the solution of the typically large system of simultaneous equations. Hence,

a more reasonable way of comparing the results is to plot the percentage error in deflection or internal moment against the number of degrees of freedom; the solution time being directly proportional to this number in the proposed decomposition technique. The total number of degrees of freedom is defined here as the

number of nodal points involved in the analysis,times the number of degrees of freedom per nodal point.

-60-

In Figs. 10, 11, 12, and 13 the percentage error in central deflection is plotted against the number of degrees of freedom of a problem for different finite elements for plate bending. Clearly, the new element shows improved results over most other elements at a given number of degrees of freedom. Similarly, in

Figs. 14 and 15, the percentage error in internal moments is plotted against the total number of degrees of freedom. As already pointed out in Section 2.3.4, existing plate elements are.deficient because they are not capable of predicting internal moments with sufficient accuracy, unless very fine mesh idealizations are used. It may be added that the evaluation of

internal moments using some of these elements represents a significant computational effort. As shown in the above-cited figures,

the refined element is capable of determining reliable internal moment values even for relatively rough meshes, thus confirming one of the basic ideas for the derivation of this element. An even better index for comparison would be the time of the computational effort needed for the entire solution of larger sized problems. In fact, the computer time needed to generate the

element stiffness matrices, to assemble the system stiffness matrix, to generate force vectors, to solve the resulting large system of simultaneous equations, and finally, to find all internal moments would be a better measure for the discussion of the relative merits of different proposed elements.

ELASTIC ANALYSIS OF STIFFENED PLATES

3.1

Introduction In this chapter, an analysis of complex shaped stiffened

plates, as shown in Fig. 16, using the finite element stiffness approach is presented. Some of the currently used approximate

analysis techniques applicable to beam-slab type structures are discussed. This survey of available methods of analysis shows

that there is as yet no fully adequate method of analysis capable of determining stresses and deformations in complex shaped beamslab type structures. It is shown thata stiffened plate structure can adequately be discretized using plate and stiffener elements. Stiff-

ness matrices for bending and in-plane behavior are derived for the beam and plate elements. A new approach for the evaluation of

the St. Venant torsional constant is presented,and the stiffness relations associated with torsion in the stiffener elements are derived. Also discussed are the assembly of the stiffness matrix
equilibri~

and the solution of the final set of

equations.

The outlined approach is applied to the analysis of a beam-slab highway bridge which was field tested. An extensive

study of the effects of the variables governing the lateral load distribution is made,demonstrating the applicability and versatility of the proposed approach. The inclusion of curb and parapet sections, as well as diaphragms, in the analysis is discussed. Finally,

'

convergence and accuracy of the method are studied. 3.2 Methods of Analysis for Stiffened Plate Structures A structural analysis is performed in order to determine stresses and deformations at selected points of a structure which is subjected to external forces, or constraint to deform, in a prescribed pattern. In this section, a short survey of some available A com-

methods of analysis of plate-beam type structures is given.

plete survey of the state of the art of current grillage design was made by Kerfoot and Ostapenko (Ref. 36). For a beam-slab type structure, an elastic analysis can be formulated by combining the. classical beam and plate theories. As is usually done in continuum mechanics, the equations of equil-

ibrium and compatibility, together with the stress-strain relations, could be used to develop a set of partial differential equations for deformations or stresses at every point of the structure. How-

ever, the exact solution of these equations is virtually impossible for complex shaped structures, because of the task of determining suitable solution functions which satisfy both the governing differential equations and the specified boundary conditions. The

assumptions introduced in the theory of plates and the conventional beam theory allow for a reduction in the number of independent variables and make certain boundary conditions more tractable. assumptions of the conventional plate theory to thin plates are listed in Section 2.2. These

which are applicable

-64-

In classical beam theory it is assumed that all deformations can be described in terms of the displacements of the longitudinal axis and the rotation of the beam cross-section. The lat-

ter assumption precludes a deformation of the cross-section, and hence,strains normal to the longitudinal axis are neglected. mulating equilibrium of a beam element leads to a set of three differential equations. Conceptually at least,. plate and beam theories can be For-

directly applied to the analysis of stiffened plate type structures. For this purpose, different physical models are used to These models are highly

represent the beam-slab type structure. redundant.

The compatibility and the load-deformation behavior

of the elements of the models must be taken into account to develop the additional requirements beyond those obtained from static equilibrium in order to determine the response of the assumed Jnodel. A force or deformation method of analysis is usually applied to solve for the unknown quantities. However, by inspecting the re-

sulting partial differential equations it can be recognized that these equations are not readily solvable for other than simple structures. Often the effective width concept is utilized to reduce the analysis of stiffened plates to the analysis of the stiffeners. This approach assumes that the stiffeners behave as beams, the flanges of which are made up of some portion of the slab. The

portion of the plate assumed to act effectively as a flange of the

-65-

beam is called the effective width of that cross section, and is often assumed to be constant along the length of the beam. This concept

is used in most methods of analysis in which the structure is treated as an open grid or as an orthotropic plate. The effective

width concept can be used to advantage in an analysis performed to determine stresses in the beams of a beam-slab type structure, but it has little merit when plate stresses are of interest. Further-

more, the effective width is not constant along the length of the stiffeners and depends on the specified boundary conditions and the distribution of applied loads. A common method of analysis is to replace the beam-plate structure by an equivalent gridwork. The resulting structure is a

framework of intersecting bars, and the stiffnesses are adjusted to approximate those of the slab and girders. The works of Lightfoot

and Sawko (Ref. 37), Hendry and Jaeger (Ref. 38) are examples of this approach. Frequently, the torsional resistance of the stiff-

eners is neglected and the effective width is always assumed to be constant along the stiffeners. A force or deformation method of.

analysis is usually applied to determine the unknown stresses or deformations in the resultant highly indeterminate structure. Clarkson (Ref. 39) has presented an example of the application of the force method to the analysis of grillages under transverse loads, neglecting the effects of torsion and shear. The same

author (Ref. 39) also used the deformation method of analysis to analyze transversely loaded grillages, taking into account the

-66-

effects of shear and St. Venant torsion.

In a similar approach,

Lightfoot and Sawko (Ref. 37) analyzed transversely loaded grillages, neglecting the shearing deformations. In addition, anum-

ber of approximate methods have been proposed, each necessitating .a number of additional assumptions and thus reducing the scope of applicability of such methods. Although these methods are appar-

ently adequate for determining the bending moments in the beams under transverse loading, their range of applicability is restricted to simple geometry. Furthermore, these methods cannot

be used directly to accurately predict the stresses in the plate of such a structure. Since the structural behavior of some grillages is similar to that of a plate, approaches have been proposed using orthotropic plate theory in the analysis of grillages. Here, the stiff-

ness of the plate and beams are lumped into an orthotropic plate of equivalent stiffness. Strictly speaking, orthotropic plate

theory could only be used if the beams are symmetric with respect to the plate and if transverse stiffeners are perpendicular to longitudinal stiffeners. In the case of a large deformation anal-

ysis, the behavior of the analogous orthotropic plate is governed by two coupled non-linear partial differential equations and again, these equations are difficult to solve. In a stress analysis of

grillages subjected to transverse loads alone, the set of differential equations can be reduced further. Vitals, Clifton, and Au

(Ref. 40) have applied this form of analysis to highway girder bridges

-67-

consisting of a concrete slab acting compositely with steel beams. Bares and Massonnet (Ref. 41) have published a book devoted to the analysis and design of grillages under transverse loads by means of the orthotropic plate theory. This approach cannot be used to

adequately predict the state of stress in the plate and the governing differential equations are again difficult to solve for other than simply bounded structures. Another group of approaches are the discrete element methods. These methods replace the actual structure by a system

of discrete elements which leads to a set of simultaneous algebraic equations. These equations are developed directly by replacing the

differential equation by the corresponding finite difference equations. Hennikoff (Ref. 42) presented a number of gridwork models

for the solution of plate bending and elasticity problems, along with guidelines for establishing the equivalence between the model and the continuum. Newmark (Ref. 43) has proposed a model made up Recently, Lopez and

of rigid barÂ·s and springs for plate bending.

Ang (Ref. 44) developed a lumped parameter model by means of which the effects of large deformation and inelastic behavior can be included in the analysis of plates. In order to simplify the pro-

blem, the analysis herein has been restricted to sandwich plates. Although the formulation would become more difficult, this method could probably be used to analyze stiffened plates. To analyze complex shaped stiffened plate structures, the finite element method is found to be best suited. For reasons

-68-

explained in Chapter 1, the finite element displacement approach
\

is preferable.

Gustafson (Ref. 45) has employed the finite element

approach in the analysis of skewed grillage structures subjected to transverse loads. The results of this analysis were found to

compare well with the results of tests performed on such structures. Little work has been done to take into account second order

effects and inelastic action of the material in the analysis of plates and virtually no work has been done as far as stiffened plate structures are concerned. 3.3 A Finite Element Analysis of Stiffened Plates 3.3.1 Application of the Method to the Plate and Stiffener System In this section, the application of the finite element displacement approach in the analysis of beam-slab type structures is described. The beam-slab type structure, shown in Fig. 16, can

be bounded by arbitrarily shaped boundaries as long as they fit into a rectilinear mesh. The plate is stiffened by a set of beams

running in longitudinal direction, which is assumed to be parallel to the global x-axis for all further discussions. In addition, a

set of transverse stiffeners (called diaphragms) can be present although their inclusion in the analysis will be discussed in a later section. Neither the plate nor the stiffeners need to be of

uniform thickness. The first step is to discretize the structure into a

suitable number of finite plate and stiffener elements.

to arrive at a simple formulation for this analysis,it is necessary that the stiffeners are attached along the mesh lines of the plate elements. However, they need not be continuously attached along Two types of finite elements, plate and stiffIn order

Due to the fact that the stiffeners are eccentrically attached to the plate, coupling between bending and stretching exists in the middle plane of the plate, and hence, in-plane deformations must be considered.

Derivation of Bending and In-Plane Plate Stiffness Matrices The classical theory of plates assumes that the state of

deformation in the plate can be described entirely in terms of the deformations of the middle plane of the plate. Basically, the

refined plate element, as described in Chapter 2, could be used in representing the plate behavior of the stiffened plate structure. However, due to the presence of the torsional resistance of

-71-

the beam elements, discontinuities in some curvature terms occur along the lines of intersection of the stiffeners with the plate. Since these terms were entered as unknowns in the nodal displacement vector and made continuous at the nodal points, the refined element is best not used in the present approach. Basically,

any known finite element could be used to represent the out-ofplane plate behavior. For the present analysis, the ACM element, as originally proposed by Adini, Clough and Melosh (Ref. 34) and described in detail by Zienkiewicz (Ref. 6), is taken to represent the out-ofplane plate behavior. An incomplete third-order polynomial, as

indicated in Fig. 5, is assumed for the representation of the displacement behavior within the element:

Since this element will also be used for the elastic-

plastic analysis of plates and stiffened plates, which will be presented in later chapters, the stiffness matrix is presented in Appendix III. In order to determine the stiffness characteristics of the entire structure, which are required in the analysis, the stiffness properties of the plate elements for in-plane behavior

must also be established.

As shown in Fig. 4, the displacement

components governing the in-plane behavior are denoted by u and v, respectively. The selection of appropriate displacement func-

A prime is attached to the unknown generalized coordinates to underline that they are not the same set as originally used. From

Pascal's triangle, as shown in Fig. 5, it is noted that all of the constant and linear terms are chosen, along with one of the quadratic terms. The chosen functions are not complete polynomials. But,

with the choice of the symmetric terms a ' xy and a ' xy,and because 4 8 of the geometric symmetry of the element itself, no preferential direction exists. Inclusion of all pertinent constant strains is

assured,as well as proper representation of the rigid body motion states. From the equations it can be
co~cluded

that all edges dis-

place as straight lines.

Hence, the chosen displacement functions

automatically guarantee continuity of displacement with adjacent elements. The assumed shape functions are of the conforming type

-73-

and since all the criteria listed in Section 2.3.2 are met, convergence to the true solution should occur. Enforcing compati-

bility of deformation at all nodal points, the unknown vector of generalized coordinates can be determined. The evaluation of the

stiffness matrix governing the in-plane behavior of the plate element follows standard procedures. more detail in Appendix IV. 3.3.3 Derivation of Bending and In-Plane Beam Stiffness Matrix The final stiffness relations for the stiffened plate structure express equilibrium at nodal points lying in the plane of reference. The response of the beams with respect to this plane It is first assumed that a stiffener, as This derivation is performed in

of reference is needed.

shown in Fig. 17, is attached to the plate along a boundary of the rectangular plate element. Next, it is assumed that external

loads are applied only at plate elements or directly at the nodal points; Furthermore, it is assumed that the stiffener is symmetric

with respect to its local z-axis,and weak in bending about this axis. In addition, shearing deformations are neglected. It should

be noted that some of these restrictions could be lifted in a more refined analysis. Owing to the above assumptions, only four of the five displacement components introduced at each nodal point of the reference surface are used to describe the behavior of the stiffener

-74-

element.

The assumed displacement function for the in-plane be-

havior of the plate element predicts straight lines for the edges of the deformed plate elements. Consequently, no bending moments Hence,

about the local z-axis are taken by the stiffener elements.

the displacement component v in the direction of they-axis does not need to be considered in describing the behavior of the beam elements. Since the stiffener element is assumed to be integrally

attached to the plate, compatibility of deformation must be enforced along the juncture line between beam and plate. The same

displacement functions chosen for the in-plane and the out-of-plane behavior of the plate element must be taken for the stiffener element in order to be able to satisfy this requirement:

Inclusion of Torsional Stiffness of Beam Elements The torsional resistance of the beams is often of impor-

tance in the behavior of stiffened plates.

In beam theory (Ref.

46), it is shown that the total twisting moment applied to a beam is resisted by two different kinds of torsion, St. Venant or pure torsion,and warping torsion: T

= TSt.V.

+ Tw

(3. 21)

The St. Venant torsional moment is resisted by shearing stresses, whereas the warping torsional moment is carried by axial stresses introduced due to flange bending. For rectangular or stocky solid

beam cross sections, most of the applied'twisting moment is carried by St. Venant torsion, whereas thin-walled !-sections carry most of the applied torsional moment by warping action.. moments are related to the angle of
twist~

Warping is not considered in the presently proposed finite element approach for the analysis of stiffened plates. To account for warping, the higher order derivatives of the angle of twist should be included in the choice of the unknown displacement components intraduced at the nodal points.

This stiffness relation, together with the previously derived Eq. 3.20, describes the behavior of an eccentrically stiffened beam element with respect to the plane of reference. These

relationships, together with the previously derived stiffness relations for the in-plane and out-of-plane behavior of the plate elements, are the basic components of the presented analysis of stiffened plate structures. 3.3.5 Evaluation of the St. Venant Torsional Constant KT The torsional stiffness matrix derived in the previous section can be evaluated once the St. Venant torsional constant KT of the stiffener section is known. The estimation of KT may pre-

sent difficulties depending on the cross section of the stiffener. As shown in Ref. 48, for example, St. Venant torsion is governed by the partial differential equation:

differential equation is to use the finite-difference method since its application is relatively simple. An alternate way of solving this differential equation was found in the process of this investigation. The method is based

on the fact that the differential equation of torsion and that of the corresponding transversely loaded plate problem are formally identical,and thus,a solution can be accomplished by solving the corresponding plate problem using the finite element method. technique is described in detail in Appendix V.

Assembly of the System Stiffness Matrix and Solution of the Field Equations The assembly of the component stiffness matrices, as

derived in the previous sections, to the system is described in this section.

stiffness matrix

The stiffness matrices of the indi-

vidual elements can be assembled to form a single stiffness matrix, called system stiffness matrix of the entire structure. This pro-

cedure is explained in detail in Section 2.3.1. For the present analysis, the in-plane displacements u in x-direction and v in y-direction, the deflection w,and the two slopes of the deflected surface are entered as unknowns at each nodal point. The vector of nodal displacements at node i is intro-

duced as follows:

the in-plane and out-of-plane behavior of a plate element is of size 20 x 20,and is best assembled in a digital computer. The stiffness coefficients for each adjoining element can simply be added for the different elements framing into a common node. In fact, this operation establishes equilibrium of

forces at a node in the direction of each of the five introduced nodal displacement components. Each row of the assembled stiff-

ness matrix represents an equilibrium equation found by enforcing equilibrium of nodal forces and the generalized loads at a given node,for one of the five degrees of freedom. Once this system

stiffness matrix is assembled, the final stiffness relations for

From this point on, one can proceed as in the usual finite element displacement approach, described in Section 2.3.1. It should be noted that only displacement type boundary conditions can be satisfied exactly because only displacement components are entered as unknowns in the nodal displacement vector. Upon enforce-

ment of the known displacements as described in Section 2.4.3, the system of simultaneous equations, represented by Eq. 3.45, can be solved. Large systems of simultaneous equations require special The

solution techniques in order to minimize computer costs.

Choleski decomposition technique, as described in Section 2.4.5, was used,and proved to be very efficient.
