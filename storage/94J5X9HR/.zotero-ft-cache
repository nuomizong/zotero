Abstract A reÂ®ned higher-order displacement model for the study of the behavior of concentrically and eccentrically stiÂened laminated plates based on C0 Â®nite element discretization is presented. The model incorporates non-linear variations of longitudinal displacements through the thickness and hence eliminates the need to use shear correction coeÂcient(s). Transverse sh?ear deformations are included in the formulation making the model applicable for both moderately thick and thin composite stiÂened plates. The plate element used is a nine-noded isoparametric one with seven degrees of freedom at each node. The stiÂener element is a three-noded isoparametric beam element with four degrees of freedom at each node. The stiÂness of a stiÂener is reÂ¯ected at all nine nodes of the plate element in which it is placed. Accordingly, the stiÂeners can be positioned anywhere within the plate element along lines of constant natural coordinates and need not necessarily be placed on nodal lines which gives a great Â¯exibility in the choice of mesh size. The integrals are evaluated by a selectively reduced integration (SRI) technique with three and two Gauss quadrature rules for membrane-Â¯exure and shear parts, respectively. The present formulation is checked for diÂerent examples of stiÂened plates made of isotropic and Â®ber-reinforced composites, and results are compared with existing analytical and other Â®nite element solutions. # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

1. Introduction StiÂened plates are used extensively in many industrial structures. Aerospace structures, road bridges, ship hulls, etc. consisting of rib reinforced plated structures are designed to withstand both transverse and inplane loading. An economical design is achieved through a proper selection of the plate and the stiÂener sizes. A number of analytical/numerical models for the analysis of stiÂened plates have been proposed in the literature. Among these, the performance of simple models like the grillage models [1] and orthotropic models [2] are not satisfactory for solving generalized

stiÂened plate/shell problems. A more accurate model is achieved by representing the plate and stiÂeners separately and maintaining compatibility between them. DiÂerent analytical methods and numerical techniques such as the RayleighÂ±Ritz method [3], Â®nite diÂerence method [4], constraint method of analysis [5], semianalytic Â®nite diÂerence method [6], transfer matrix, Â®nite strip, wave approaches and Â®nite element method [7Â±11], have been used to solve the problem. Biswal and Ghosh [12] developed a four-noded rectangular element with seven degrees of freedom at each node for the analysis of laminated plates. A review of the static analysis of stiÂened plates can be found in [13]. Among all the numerical methods, the Â®nite element method has been found to be reasonably accurate with less complexity to model stiÂened plates.

Gupta and Ma [14] and Balmer [15] investigated the use of linear shape functions for approximating axial displacements in beam Â®nite elements used as eccentric stiÂeners with linear transformation of the nodal displacements. They found that this leads to an inconsistency which can result in large errors in deÂ¯ections and stresses of stiÂened plates. Miller [16] introduced additional degrees of freedom for these elements to overcome this problem. Miller also found that the inconsistency introduced by using the Â®rst degree polynomial representation for axial displacement in beam Â®nite element leads to rather large errors in the prediction of dynamic behavior of stiÂened plates [17] and the added d.o.f. reduces this error considerably. Deb and Booton [8] in their model FEM(M1) overcome the problem of inconsistency by assuming quadratic shape functions for all displacements of the stiÂeners. Deb and Booton [8], Thompson et. al. [9] and Satsangi and Mukhopadhyay [10] used eight-noded serendipity elements as the plate element and assumed that the stiffeners follow the same displacement Â®eld as that of the plating. However, the eight-noded plate element has been found to lock in shear for thin plates for certain boundary conditions and mesh conÂ®gurations even when reduced integration (RI) [18] and selectively reduced integration (SRI) techniques [19,20] are used. In addition it has been also reported [19] that this element is comparably more sensitive to element shape distortions and element aspect ratios. Hence, the appli-

cation of this element for the analysis of complex structures is questionable [11]. Whereas the performance of the nine-noded Lagrangian plate/shell element with either RI or SRI has been proved to be near optimal [18,19] even for very thin plates. This paper presents the development of a stiÂened composite plate element model using a nine-noded plate element and a three-noded stiÂener element. The model is based on a higher order shear deformation theory which assumes a realistic cross-sectional deformation pattern. This eliminates the need to use shear correction coeÂcients and make the model applicable for both moderately thick and thin stiÂened composite plates. The eÂect of stiÂeners is incorporated by internally constraining the stiÂener displacement Â®elds to the relevant plate displacement Â®elds. The stiÂeners can be positioned anywhere within the plate element along lines of constant natural coordinates and need not necessarily be placed on nodal lines as the stiÂness matrix of a stiffened plate element is comprised of the contributions of the plate element and that of the stiÂener elements.

2. Formulation The geometry of the problem is similar to that shown in Fig. 1. A stiÂened plate element is composed of a plate element and a number of stiÂener elements placed along its lines of constant natural coordinates r

and s. Both plate and stiÂeners are made up of laminated composites (built up of layers of Â®ber-reinforced material with diÂerent orientations). The principal assumptions in the present formulation are: 1. normal stress sz in a direction normal to the plane of the plate is negligible, 2. a typical stiÂener section is symmetric about a vertical plane through its center-line, 3. in-plane bending deformations of stiÂeners are neglected, and 4. stiÂeners have negligible torsional stiÂness. To account for the transverse shear deformations, a higher order displacement Â®eld is employed. The displacement model is derived out of a power series expansion of the mid-surface displacements in the power of the thickness coordinates as: Plate: Up Âx,y,z Â Â up Âx,y Â Â zyxp Âx,y Â Â z3 yÃ Âx,y Â xp Vp Âx,y,z Â Â vp Âx,y Â Â zyyp Âx,y Â Â z3 yÃ Âx,y Â yp Wp Âx,y,z Â Â wp Âx,y Â Â1Â

mesh size. The proposed model has been applied to a number of problems including concentrically and eccentrically isotropic and composite stiÂened plates under diÂerent loading conditions and stacking sequences. The results obtained have been compared with available exact and numerical results. The comparison has shown that the present model is reliable and accurate. In order to compare the eÂciency of unstiÂened and stiÂened composite plates, one or more layers of laminated plates have been replaced by stiÂeners keeping the total volume of the material the same. Remarkable improvements in stiÂness and strength of the laminates have been found

4. Conclusion A reÂ®ned higher order displacement model for the analysis of concentric and eccentric stiÂened composite plates is presented. The model incorporates non-linear variations of longitudinal displacements across the thickness and hence eliminates the need to use shear correction coeÂcients. The model incorporates a ninenoded isoparametric plate element and three-noded isoparametic stiÂener element. The formulation allows the positioning of stiÂener elements anywhere within the plate element along lines of constant natural coordinates which gives a great Â¯exibility in the choice of
