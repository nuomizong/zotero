Abstract Thermomechanical properties and responses of dual-phase functionally graded materials have been estimated by conventional averaging approaches, such as rules of mixtures, mean-ï¬eld micromechanics and so on. However, the appropriateness of such models has been recently reported to be questionable. In this paper, we numerically investigated three representative averaging estimation methods, the linear and modiï¬ed rules of mixtures and the Wakashimaâ Tsukamoto estimate, by comparing with the ï¬nite-element discretization approach utilizing rectangular cells. Through numerical experiments for the elastic and thermoelastic response of Niâ Al2O3 functionally graded materials (FGMs), we presented comparative results together with introduction of a suggestive approach.

1. Introduction Compared with classical laminated composite materials, functionally graded materials (FGM) provide superior thermomechanical performances under given loading circumstances, thanks to the continuously and functionally varying volume composition of constituent particles [1â3]. In order to achieve the best performance, accurate material â property estimation is essential because the associated analysis and design for selecting an optimal volume â fraction variation depends deï¬nitely on its suitability [4]. From the introduction of FGMs, conventional averaging methods for usual dual-phase composites, such as the rules of mixture [5], the mean-ï¬eld micromechanics models [6,7], the unit cell model [8] and so on, have been widely employed to estimate thermomechanical properties. Owing to the assumptions made for them, while easily predicting the overall thermomechanical behavior, those may be insufï¬cient to predict the reliable thermoelastic behavior of FGMs. As is well

known, the response of phase materials in reality relies on the shape and size, the orientation and dispersion structure of constituents and the loading and boundary conditions [4,9]. Recently, the numerical analysis approaches utilizing ï¬nite-element discretized models, for the accurate behavior prediction, have been proposed by several investigators. Dvorak et al. [9] presented a discrete micromechanics model in which each inclusion is replaced with a planar hexagonal cell, and carried out the comparative numerical experiments in order for the assessment of the Mori âTanaka method for various dispersion structures. And Grujicic and Zhang [10] proposed a numerical analysis technique for determining the accurate effective microstructure-dependent elastic properties, by utilizing the Voronoi cell ï¬nite element method (VCFEM). In this paper, we numerically compared the elastic and thermoelastic predictions by three representative averaging approaches, the linear and modiï¬ed rules of mixtures and the Wakashima âTsukamoto estimate, with those predicted by ï¬nite-element discretized models employing rectangular cells. This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 a brief description of the averaging and ï¬nite-element

discretization approaches is given. The results of comparative numerical experiments are presented and discussed in Section 3. The conclusions drawn from the current work are listed in Section 4.

2. Dual-phase FGMs and material-property estimation approaches

2.1. Dual-phase functionally graded materials
Fig. 1(a) illustrates a possible composition distribution of metal âceramic functionally graded materials in reality. In this paper, however we consider the restricted dual-phase FGM cases, for our purpose, in which the dispersion structure is spatially well-deï¬ned and furthermore the volume fraction is invariant in any one direction. A schematic view of our discrete models with rectangular cells, while the detailed description on construction will be given later, is presented in Fig. 1(b), where the metal volume fraction Vm is linearly varying from 100% at the bottom surface to 0% at the top surface. The dark areas correspond to metal particles while the bright areas ceramic particles. Even though many possible function types for deï¬ning the volume fraction exist, we here deï¬ne the volume fractions Vm and Vc of metal and ceramic, respectively, as follows: Vm(y)= [(dG â y)/2dG]N Vc(y)= 1âVm(y) (1)

in which N are non-negative real numbers. As is presented in Fig. 1(c), changing the value of N generates an inï¬nite number of composition distributions.

2.2. A6eraging approaches for the o6erall response and material properties
For the thermomechanical response and material â property estimation of phase composite materials, a

large number of papers have been published, and which can be classiï¬ed broadly into theoretical and experimental categories [9]. Furthermore, theoretical approaches can be split into microscopic-level (considering the interaction between matrix and inclusions) and continuum-level (in terms of only volume fraction and individual properties of constituent phases) studies. However, so far the latter approaches have been widely employed, and which are generally divided into direct, variational and approximation methods [7]. The direct approach seeks the closed-form analytic solutions for the averaged properties, wherein geometrical and other simpliï¬cations are made for easy mathematical derivation, however which requires rigorous mathematical treatment. As an alternative approach, which can relax the rigorous mathematical treatment, the variational approach provides the upper and lower bounds for the overall properties in terms of the phase volume fraction [11]. Besides the bounded-form estimation, this approach does not specify the details in the phase geometry, thus one requires some reasonable approximations to obtain suitable closed-form estimates. Finally, in the approximation approach, the self-consistent models by Hill [12] and other early investigators, the mean-ï¬eld micromechanics models by Mori â Tanaka [6] and Wakashima and Tsukamoto [7], the rules of mixtures and the unit cell model by Ravichandran [8] are representative averaging estimates. These methods are simple and convenient to apply for predicting the overall material properties and responses, however, owing to the assumed simpliï¬cations the validity is affected by the detailed microstructure and others. We here brieï¬y describe three considering methods, the linear rule of mixtures, the modiï¬ed rule of mixtures by Tamura et al. [5] and the Wakashima â Tsukamoto estimate. According to the linear rule of mixtures, the simplest estimate, any material property P(x) at a point x in

The modiï¬ed rule of mixtures is restricted to the Youngâs modulus, so any appropriate averaging method must be used to estimate the other thermomechanical properties. Usually, the linear rule of mixtures is being conventionally employed [1,3,5]. On the other hand, the Wakashima âTsukamoto estimate is derived based on the modiï¬ed Eshelbyâs equivalent inclusion method by incorporating the Mori âTanaka concept. In this estimate, the averaged material property P are deï¬ned by

where d refers to a representative volume element (RVE) and Â· d the averall quantities. We record the detailed formula for this estimate in Appendix A.

Because this estimate can not reï¬ect the detailed constituent geometry, the dispersion structure and so on, its accuracy is well known to be highly questionable. In order to predict the Youngâs modulus of dualphase materials with higher accuracy, Tamura et al. [5] introduced the modiï¬ed rule of mixtures in 1976, which has been subsequently adopted by many other investigators for their studies. According to this estimate, each sublayer in the graded layer is treated as an isotropic one, for which uniaxial stress | and strain m are expressed in terms of the average stresses and strains and the volume fractions of metal and ceramic constituents | =|mVm + |c(1âVm) m =mmVm + mc(1â Vm) (3)

2.3. Finite-element discretization approaches
Recently, new numerical analysis approaches utilizing the ï¬nite element method are being intensively studied, in order for the more accurate prediction of thermoelastic behaviors of FGMs and the assessment of the classical averaging methods, in which the profound inï¬uence of stochastic dispersion of heterogeneities is taken into consideration. Among them two numerical techniques are noteworthy, the Voronoi cell ï¬nite element method (VCFEM) by Ghosh and Mukhopadhyay [13], Grujicic and Zhang [10] and the discrete micromechanics approach by Dvorak et al. [4]. Referring to Fig. 2 illustrating the Voronoi cell ï¬nite element method, a composite domain is discretized into a network of Voronoi polygons by Dirichlet tessellation such that each polygon contains one inclusion at most. In other words, a Voronoi cell serves as a representative material element (RME), and which is considered as a ï¬nite element. By applying the Pian âGhoshâs assumed stress hybrid ï¬nite-element formulation [13] to the generated network, the global and local deformation and stress ï¬elds as well as the effective material properties are approximated. This method has been reported to provide more reliable local responses and material properties, for randomly dispersed dual-phase composite materials, when compared to the results predicted by averaging approaches. So it has been widely applied to FGMs over the entire composition range. However, according to Ghosh et al. [13], its superior accuracy may rather deteriorate when the volume fraction of second phase becomes higher because it does not include the macromicro scale effect. On the other hand, in the discrete micromechanics

Clearly, q= 0 and q = +â¬ correspond to property averaging with equal stress and strain, respectively. According to experiments with dual-phase steels, the value q of 4.5 GPa has been reported to be appropriate within a wide range of volume fractions and loading condition [1]. From Eqs. (3) and (4), the averaged Youngâs modulus is calculated by E=

It is worth to note, from Eq. (5), that the averaged Youngâs modulus tends to one by the linear rule of mixtures as q approaches +â¬.

approach, a distribution of constituents is generated by allocating planar hexagonal cells of equal size according to a speciï¬ed volume fraction, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Differing from the former approach, each cell is subdivided into several ï¬nite elements, hence it requires painstaking elaboration for generating numerical models with arbitrary volume fraction. On the hand, usual standard ï¬nite element method can be directly applicable, and excessive stress discontinuities can be remarkably relaxed because each cell is again descritized into several ï¬nite elements. This approach serves as a reference tool for the assessment of conventional averaging methods. However, it requires reasonably ï¬ne hexagonal cells and ï¬nite elements for the reliable approximations so that it requires rather expensive efforts.

3.1. Preliminary experiment
As is cleared from Eq. (5), the averaged Youngâs modulus by the modiï¬ed rule of mixtures is inï¬uenced by the choice of q. Therefore one needs to select the appropriate value of q for dual-phase material under consideration. Even though 4.5 GPa has been reported to be suitable for a wide range of volume fractions, it has been justiï¬ed through the experiments with dualphase steels. Before our main comparative experiments, we ï¬rst evaluate the value of q through the comparison of deï¬ection and strain energy predicted by the modiï¬ed rule of mixtures with those by the ï¬nite-element discretized approach. For this preliminary experiment, referring to Fig. 4(a), we clamped the left end of beam (i.e. ux = uy = 0 at x= 0) and apply a downward point load Py = â 30 kN at the point A (i.e. at x=L and y=0). In this case, the metal volume fraction in the graded layer is linearly varying (i.e. N= 1), and the Poissonâs ratio for the modiï¬ed rule of mixtures is computed by the linear rule of mixtures. Fig. 5 shows the comparative variation of the tip deï¬ection and the total strain energy along the number of cells, where the averaging methods exhibit the monotonic convergence. Furthermore, the ï¬nite-element discretized model possess the convergence, while it shows a ï¬uctuation behavior owing to the random generation of composition dispersion. From the plots of the modiï¬ed rule of mixtures, we see that the material

3. Numerical experiments For our numerical experiments, we select Ni and Al2O3 as metal and ceramic phases, respectively, and corresponding material data are given in Table 1. Throughout the numerical experiments we assume that two material phases are linearly elastic and temperature-independent. Fig. 4(a) shows a two-dimensional FGM beam composed of Ni-graded- and Ni â Al2O3-layers. In the graded layer the metal volume fraction is varying through the thickness, according to the function given in Eq. (1). In order to generate a ï¬nite-element dicretized model, we subdivide the FGM domain into 200Ã120 uniform rectangular cells (200 in the x-axis and 120 in the y-axis) of four-node isoparametric ï¬nite elements. A speciï¬ed volume fraction is accomplished in a manner that cells in the same row are assigned to Ni or Al2O3, in proportion to the volume fraction at that vertical location, according to the random-number generation algorithm. Three ï¬nite-element discretized models, for N = 0.5, 1.0 and 5, respectively, are presented in Fig. 4(b).

model becomes stiffer as the value of q increases. On the other hand, we observe, by comparing both material-property approaches, that the ï¬nite-element discretized model approaches sequentially the modiï¬ed rule of mixtures with q of 500 GPa. Youngâs modulus distributions for various values of q are presented in Fig. 6 together with ones by the linear rule of mixtures and the Wakashima â Tsukamoto estimate. The linear rule of mixtures exhibits the stiffest estimation, while the modiï¬ed rule of mixtures with q of 200 GPa and the Wakashima â Tsukamoto estimate show good agreement each other.

3.2. Elastic loading cases
In order to examine the elastic response, according to averaging and ï¬nite-element discretization approaches, we consider two loading cases depicted in Fig. 7. In which geometry dimensions are the same as given in Fig. 5. For the ï¬rst loading case, we apply uniform axial displacement ux =0.02 mm at the right end together with a roller support at the bottom of the right

symmetry boundary condition is speciï¬ed at the left end. For beams, which have x-invariant material property distribution and geometry, under traction tensions, there occurs the edge effect in stress ï¬eld, when the length dimension is ï¬nite. We see, from Fig. 8(a) and (b), that the traction tension case produces remarkable edge effect in the vicinity of the right end, while the displacement tension case shows a perfectly x-invariant axial stress distribution (i.e. edge-effect-free). Because we are interested in the stress distribution through the thickness, we take thickness-wise stress distributions at the location x of 0, for the averaging methods. However, the ï¬nite-element discretized models exhibit abrupt stress discontinuities across cell interfaces, we average the nodal stress values of cell located at the same vertical location. In order to exclude the

edge effect, for the traction tension case, we include the nodal values only located within 05 x5 40 mm. Thickness-wise axial stress distributions, for both loading cases, predicted by averaging and ï¬nite-element discretization approaches for three different volume fractions are presented in Fig. 9(a) and (b), respectively. Where, the stress distributions by ï¬nite-element discretized models are not smooth but rather ï¬uctuating, owing to the abrupt stress discontinuity across cell interfaces. By comparing plots corresponding to each prediction estimate, we ï¬rst notice, regardless of the volume fraction, that the difference in stress distributions between material âproperty estimation is considerable. However, the displacement tension case does not produce any difference in Ni- and Al2O3-layers, which is resulted naturally from the enforcement of uniform strain ï¬eld. The linear rule of mixtures and the modiï¬ed rule of mixtures with q of 4.5 GPa provide lower and upper bound of estimated stresses. This is consistent well with the preliminary results given in Section 3.1. For both loading cases and three volume fractions, the prediction by ï¬nite-element discretized models is between those by the linear rule of mixtures and the Wakashima â Tsukamoto estimate. On the other hand, the stress ï¬eld prediction by the modiï¬ed rule of mixtures changes sequentially by the choice of q. In particular, for uniform strain ï¬eld, it

overestimates as q approaches + â¬ while underestimates as q tends to 0. The case with q of 500 GPa, which was chosen through the preliminary experiment, shows a good agreement with the ï¬nite-element discretization approach, for both loading cases and three volume fractions.

3.3. Thermoelastic loading cases
In order for the comparison of steady-state thermoelastic response, we consider two thermal loading conditions, a uniform temperature increase and a temperature increase at the top surface of a simply supported Ni âAl2O3 FGM beam in initial temperature Tini =300 K, as depicted in Fig. 10. Geometry and volume fraction conditions are the same as the previous static problem. Compared with elastic problems involving two material properties, the Youngâs modulus E and the Poissonâs ration w, the steady-state thermoelastic analysis involves two more material properties, the thermal expansion coefï¬cient h and the thermal conductivity s. On the other hand, in time-dependent thermo-elasticity problems, two material properties, the density z and the speciï¬c heat c, are additionally included. However, the averaged density is solely associated with the vol-

ume fractions of two constituents, so that it is computed inherently by the linear rule of mixtures. Furthermore, the averaged speciï¬c heat can be also simply estimated by this method because the higher order term is extremely negligible, as given in Eq. (A7) in Appendix A. So, these two properties, which characterize the time-dependent thermelastic behavior of FGMs, do not need any further consideration. From this point of fact, we investigate comparatively two signiï¬cant material properties, E and h, through the steady-state thermo-elasticity problem. As for the static problem case, we examine the axial stress distribution. So, we take thickness-wise stress variations at x= 0 for averaging methods. While we average the nodal stress values of cells located at the same vertical location, for the ï¬nite-element discretized models, in order to relax the abrupt stress change across cell interfaces. Because both cases exhibit the similar edge effect as the previous traction tension case, in the vicinity of the right end, we include the cell nodes only within 05x5 40 mm. Comparison of axial stress distributions for the two thermal loading cases is provided in Fig. 11(a) and (b), respectively. We note here, for the rules of mixtures, that v, h and s are computed using the linear rule of mixtures. For both loading cases and three volume fractions, the thermal stress prediction by the ï¬nite-element discretized model is shown to be considerably distant from those by averaging methods. Among the averaging methods, if we insist on saying, the Wakashima âTsukamoto estimate provides the closet prediction to the discretized models. On the other hand, linear and modiï¬ed rules of mixtures do not display any remarkable difference, in all cases, even when the value of q is changed to 500 GPa. The observation from Fig. 11(a) and (b) leads, differing from elastic problems, that the choice of thermal-

property estimation methods is more crucial for thermo-elasticity problems. When restricted to two thermal properties, h and s, we observe that the choice of s is less sensitive by comparing the plots corresponding to both loading cases. Differing from the second thermal loading case, the ï¬rst one does not include the thermal conductivity. Nevertheless, the Wakashima â Tsukamoto estimate shows almost loading-case-independent prediction characteristic (i.e. negligible inï¬uence of s on the prediction characteristic). Hence, we hereafter focus on the investigation of the thermal expansion coefï¬cient. Fig. 12 presents the comparison of thermal expansion coefï¬cient distributions, through the thickness for three volume fractions, computed using the linear rule of mixtures, the Wakashima â Tsukamoto estimate and the method proposed by Schapery [14]. We record the detailed formula of the third method in Appendix A. We can see that the Schaperyâs method coincides with the Wakashima â Tsukamoto estimate when the

Hashin âShtrikmanâs lower bound [15] is used for the . averaged bulk modulus K. Based on the observation from Fig. 12, we consider two additional material âproperty estimation cases, Mâ S and M â W â T mixed approaches. In the MâS approach, the thermal expansion coefï¬cient is computed . using the Schaperyâs method (K by the linear rule of mixtures), together with the Youngâs modulus calculated by the modiï¬ed rule of mixtures with q of 500GPa. On the other hand, in the M â W â T approach, the Youngâs modulus is estimated by the modiï¬ed rule of mixtures (q= 500 GPa), while calculating the other properties according to the Wakashima âTsukamoto estimate. Comparative numerical results are plotted in Fig. 13(a) and (b), respectively. By comparing with the Wakashima âTsukamoto results in Fig. 11(a) and (b), we can notice that the M â W â T does not produce any remarkable difference. However, we see that the MâS approach coincides well with the ï¬nite-element discretization approach, for all cases. These two points tell us, for thermo-elasticity problems, that the appropriateness of thermal expansion coefï¬cient is more important than one of the Youngâs modulus. Furthermore, the MâS approach provides the best prediction for the thermoelastic response, when judged on the ï¬nite-element discretization approach.

4. Conclusions In order to comparatively investigate the representative classical volume-averaged material âproperty estimates for the spatially well-dispersed Ni âAl2O3 dual-phase functionally graded materials, and to ï¬nd out a more reliable prediction approach for the

Youngâs modulus and the thermal expansion coefï¬cient for the numerical analysis, we studied the ï¬nite-element discretization approach utilizing rectangular cells. Above all, the introduced discretization technique can be easily implemented, because not only any micromechanics models with arbitrary volume fraction distributions can be generated without painstaking elaboration, according to the random-number generation algorithm, but also the numerical accuracy can be guaranteed by increasing the total cell number. As well, it does not require any special formulation technique for applying the ï¬nite element method. Furthermore, we conï¬rmed that the ï¬nite-element discretized model shows a sequential convergence in the elastic response, along the total cell number. According to the comparative numerical experiments, for elastic and thermoelastic loading cases, the following main observations are drawn, together with the proposal of a reliable material â property estimation approach for the numerical analysis of FGMs. 1. From the numerical results in the elastic loading cases, we observed that the modiï¬ed rule of mixtures produces a sequentially varying prediction of stress distribution, along the value of q, such that two limit cases serve the lower and upper bounds of stress predictions by the other estimates. On the other hand, the stress prediction by our discretized models is located between those by the Wakashima â Tsukamoto estimate and the linear rule of mixtures. 2. From the thermoelastic loading cases, we observed that almost all of averaging estimates produces stress distributions with considerable difference from those by ï¬nite-element discretized models. Among them, the Wakashima â Tsukamoto estimate shows the closest results, while the modiï¬ed rule of mixtures does not exhibit any remarkable difference for different values q. Furthermore, the M â W â T approach produces almost the same thermal stress prediction with the Wakashima âTsukamoto estimate. 3. However, the proposed M â S approach predicted stress distributions consistent quite well with those predicted by ï¬nite-element discretized models, for thermoelastic loading as well as elastic loading.

It is worth while noting that these expressions coincide with the Hashin âShtrikmanâs lower bounds [15].

in which TR refers to a reference temperature. On the other hand, according to Schapery [14], the averaged thermal expansion coefï¬cient of dual-phase composites with arbitrary phase geometry is estimated using . 1/KL â 1/K (h â hc) (A8) h=hmVm + hcVc â 1/Km â 1/Kc m . in which 1/KL = Vm/Km + Vc/Kc. In addition, K refers to the averaged bulk modulus of dual-phase composites. When the Hashin âShtrikmanâs lower bound is . used for K, Wakashima âTsukamoto and Schapery estimates, Eqs. (A5) and (A8), show coincident results each other, as depicted in Fig. 12. We note that the linear rule of mixtures for this property is justiï¬ed when the difference of thermal expansion coefï¬cients of two phases is less than 1Ã 10 â 6 K â 1 [14]. References
