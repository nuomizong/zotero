Abstract
-4 desigri nietliotloloÃ§y for the optirnization of stiffencd plates with frequency and

biickling constrairits is prescnted. The basic idea of the rnethodology is to consider a plate witli a fairly dense1 distribution of stiffeners. Tliickness of the plate aiid stiffeners, and the stiffencr nidtli arc the design variables. Dcsign variable linking is accomplishcd by the use
of r a t i ~ n a spline surfaces. The finite element method is used for the iinÃ¼lysis. The plate l

is riiodelecl using iiriear SIindlin plate elemcnts and the stiffcncrs by liriear Timostienko

hcarii elemmts. Botli the plate and beani clements arc shear-locking free by forniulation:
\vit lioiit requiring ariy special techniques such as reduced integration. Results for a square

stiffcnecl plate witli three different stiffener Iayout patterns and differeiit stiffcner densityl arc presented. The best four stiffener coiifigurations which gice the lowest mass are cliosen and applied to ?:1 and 3:l rectangular plates. It is concluded that the preserit design iiiethoclology giws good results. and that the stiffener pattern and stiffener density play ari iniportant role in reducing the mass of a stiffeneci plate.

'Refers to the measure of the number of stiffeners and there spacings and NOT to the density of the stiffener material.

Dedicated to my beloved parents and sister, whose love, support, and encouragement, words caiinot describe.

Introduction
hlan has always bceii inspired by nature. be it art, or engineering. Perhaps one of the dcrivat ivcs of siicli inspirat ion is stiffened engineering structures.
Sca shells. leaves. trecs. vegetables - aII of these are: in fact. stiffened structures.

Ob-

serlatioiis of structures created by naturc indicate that in most cases strengt.h and rigidit~.
cIc?pciitl iiot

orily or1 the niaterial but also iipon its form. This fact \vas probably noticed

long ago by soiiie slirwcl observers and resulted in the creatiori of artificial structural elemerits having high bearing capacity niainly due to their forni. suc11 as. girders, arches and shells [IO. Chapter 11. Tlie wide use of stiffened structural elernents in engineering begari in the nineteenth century: mainly with the application of stccl plates for the hulls of ships and with dcvclopment of steel bridges and aircraft structures. Stiffened plates noir find applications in modern industry [ibid.]. Stiffeners in a stifkned plate make it possible to resist highly directional loads, and introduce rnultiple load paths that may provide protection against damage and crack growth under bot*licompressive and tensile loads. The biggest advantage of the stiffeners. tliough, is the increased bending stiffness of the panel with a minimum of additional material, which makes t hese structures highly desirable for out-of-plane loads and destabilizing compressive loads [S. page 4511.

In addition to the advantages already found in using them, there should be no doubt
that stiffened plates designed with optimization techniques will be bring many benefits like swings in material usage, cost, better performance, etc.

1.1

Literature Survey and Motivation

The riiotivation beliind the work presented here is the papcr on plate optimization by Cheng and Ollioff [JI. They were trying to solve a plate sizing optiniizatioti. with the plate being ~iiodeledby Kirchoff's theory. The objective was to niiniriiize the complianre. They observed the formation of stiffeners in nuinerically cornputed 'optimal' solutions. The nurnber of stiffeners increased when the discretization of the design ivas increased. with the resulting decreasc in cornpliance. I t was suggested. that either the problern be relaxed. or thc dcsign space be restrictcd.

For a relasation of the design problem. plates with irifinitcly niany, infinitell thiri stiffcners have to be considered [3. page 2071. The bibliography in [ibid.. page 2331 @\-es
a good account of tlic research carried out in this regard. But niany of those works considered liomogcnizatioii tecliriiques to mode1 a stiffencd plate. wliicli iriay prodiicr some crrors w h m the dcnsity of stiffeners is not so high. The present work addresses this probleni by modeling the stiffeners as beani elements iising the finite elenient teclinique. Ariother iriotivating factor for the present research, is the enormous improvenient in
the inanufacttiring proccsses. Almost any sliape can be rnanufacturcd using computerized

niachining. So? a plate witli unusual thickness profile can be made by direct machining! or nioi~lds can bc made to makc high precision castings.

1.2

Objective

To develop a design rrzethodology t o optimize the mass of stiffened plates with frequency and buckling constraints.

To be more specific, a plate with stiffeners Iayed out in a certain pattern should be
considered. Sonie common stiffener patterns should be considered, and evaluated for their ability t o give optimal masses. The thickness of the plate and stiffeners, and the width of the stiffeners should be considered as design variables. Using spline approximation techniques. the design variables should be linked. Analysis should be carried out using finite element method. Appropriate finite elements should be derived.

The optimization constraints should be in the forrn of some lower bounds on the first
nat ural frequency and the cri tical buckling Ioad.

1.3

Outline of the thesis

In Cliapter 2 the finite elenient model is described and al1 the nccessary equntions for elements are derived. Also, the stiffener patterns consiclcred are the plate and the l ~ e a m introdilced. Ihlidation of the beam and platc elements, each separately for buckling as well as vibration, is s h o w in Chapter 3. Cliaptcr 4 is devoted t o esplaining the optimization model. Defiiiition of the design variables of the problerii, linking them to reduce the riumber of design variables. and t h optiniiznt ion cquations arc a 1 found hcre. l Resiilts, aiid disciissions are given in Chapter 5 . Here the resiilts for a square platc n i t li various st i ffener configurations are presented. Those configurations wliicli give the
best rcsults arc applicd to rcctangiilar plates and their results are showri.

The prcscnt work is surnmarized and concluded in the Chapter 6.

Stiffener Layout Pattern

Ctivcri the way the plate is discretized in the present work? that is, dividing the plate into
nian- squares. dkiding eacli square into four triangular elements, as shown in Figure 2.2.

the niimber of options for stiffener layout pattern is srnall. Sonie symmetric patterns have been chosen. and are sliomn in Figure 2.3, dong with there reference names. It is qui te obvious that the stiffeners can be arranged wit h clifferent spacings. Hence comes into picture the kiensity' of stiffeners. A quantity called Stifener Densitg Factor

(SDF) can be defined for the purpose of laying out the stiffeners with different spacings. Consider the smalIest slant stiffener running between two adjacent sides of a square plate. y For esample. in Figure 2.4, B D . Let the area of the square formed ! this diagonal be .AbTn (area ABCD in the figure). Let the area of the smallest square formed by four triangular elements be .Apr. Again referring to Figure 2.4, it is area AEFG. Then.

Figure 2.3: The various stiffener patterns and there reference names.

To define SDF for SPSQR and SPDIXSQ one must consider the sniallest square formed b the stiffeners for area Ah, and Apt remains the same as defined above.
The value of SDF cannot be any imaginable value for a given discretized plate. For esample. the FE mode1 of SPDIA stiffened plate illustrated in Figure 2.4, the eshaustive values of SDF are 1/4: 112 and 1. For SDF = 11.1,there are only two stiffeners along the two diagonals of the largest square, which is the plate itseif. For SDF = 1, al1 the diagonals of the smalIest possible squares have stiffeners.
unless othIt should be noted that the angle of the slant stiffeners SPDIA is fGo, erwise stated.

The Plate Element

The geoiiictry of the elcmcnt is given by the Cartesian coordinatcs. (.z,. y i ) . and the thicknesscs of the plate. t p , , (i=1,3.5).
In order to dcrive the equations. consider the plate element shown in Figure 2.5.

The plate element is basecl on Reissner-Mindlin Plate theory. Thereforc, the in-plane displacernent fields, fi and 0 , are assurned to Vary linearly through the plate thickness and the trariswrse displacenient. tÃ¼! is assunied constant through the plate thickness. The kinerriatic relation is given by

Element Matrices for the Buckling Problem

The buckling problem is solved in two steps: the Pre-Bucklirig Probleni and the Buckling
Pro blcm.

The Pre-Buckling Problem
The loading state in the pre-buckling problem is assumed to result from the application of
a uniforni displacenient on the plate boiindary of interest. The following assurnptions are

made:
1. The applietl load results from a uniforin displacement applied t,o tlic loaded edge. 2. The application of the boundary conditions does not induce any mechanical loads.

3. Ttic problem is linear.

The eriergy witiiin an element is only due to strain. â¬0: because of the initial displacetrient. and is giwn by.

It should be noted that the applied load results froni the specified boundary conditions. and so there is no esplicit work term due to esternal forces. By carrying out algebraic manipulations on Eq. 2.26 as in Section 2.2.1, one ultiniately gets.

General Comments About the Results

The converged results for the rectangular plate were obtained by discretizing the plate into
16 x 16 smaller rectangles, and in turn each one divided into -4 identical triangles by the diagonals. The beam results required 32 elements to give a sufficiently accurate result for the first modes of vibration and buckling, although the plots for beam convergence were drawn using up to 6-4 elements.

It can be observed from the plots the al1 the curves converge monotonically from a higher value for low DOF (Degrees Of Freedorn), to a lower value a t higher DOF, which

is typical of vibration and buckling problems. This indicates that the plate and beani clement formulation is correct.

Thc comparison tabies show ttiat for some modes of vibration and buckling, for botli the plate and beani cases. the FE (Finite Element) results are higher than the analytical rcsults. This is to be espected given the fact that different theories are being compared. That is. for the plates.

T h . optiiiiizatiori cquatioris of the prescnt work arc listed in the tliird section and a bricf iiotr abolit the optiniization routines used in the computer code is given in the final section.

4 1 Design Variables .
Section A-A

Figure 4.1: The design variables a t a cross-section.

Since a stiffened plate is being dealt with, the design variables may corne from the plate andjor the stiffeners. In t,he present study: the Iength and breadth of the plate are kept constant: howeverl the plate thickness t p at a certain point is considered as a design variable. The stiffener width 6 is another design variable, but it is assumed that al1 the stiffeners have the same width. As mentioned earlier, symmetric stiffeners are assurned, so

the dcpth t of the stiffener projecting out of the surface of the plate is taken as a dcsign mriablc (sec Figure 4.1). Diic to the F u t that Finite Element Analysis would be used, tlie plate is discretizcd. be Ideally. it ~ - o u l d less work if t p , and t at each node are corisidered as design variables. but the nuniber of design variables would become too large to tiandlc with the a\-ailable resoiirces. Therefore. resort is niade to what is commonly called .design variable linking'.

for the solution of non-linear constrained optimization problems. The program is segmented into three levels: strategy. optiniizer: and one-dimensional search.

options are al-ailable so that a total of over 100 possible combinations can be created. Of the many possible combinations that were consistent with the problem; one was found to give a converged feasible result with the least number of function evaluations - the strategy,

Initial Design
The first step in the optimization process is, obviously, choosing an initial design. For the
optimization strategy beirig used in the present study. that is, Sequential Linear Programming, problems may arise if started with a n infeasible initial design [S. pp 231:232]. Hcnce.
by trial and error a feasible design was obtained, and is s h o w in Table 5.2. The initial

design is a flÃ¼t plate with SPDIA (SDF = 112) stiffeners, al1 having the sarnc depth. and width. SPDIA Kas chosen to try something other than the conventional SPSQR. wliich woiilcl be considered later in some other cases. The SDF = 112 was cliosen because. it produws a rnoderatrly dense stiffener pattern. Note that if the stifferier density is too iiigh. then that rnay prodiicc a final optirnurn design wliich is heavier than an optimum design produced by a lower SDF value. But a t the sanie time if the stiffener density is very low thcri tlic stiffeners n i q - pla lesser role in the design.

Notice that the mass of the present stiffened platc is already 91.72% Iower than tlic refererice plate. reinforcing the Fact that the stiffened plates have better charac teristics, and at the same tinie have a l o w r mass.

Finite Element and Optimization Models
Because the problem is sy~nnietric.only a quarter plate with sylnrnetry boundary conditions was iised for FE analysis. Hence. the plate was discretizcd into Y x S. instead of 16 x 16. squares eacli containing four siniilar triangles. (It niay be recalled that for a rectangiilar platc. FE convergence studies sliowed that discretizatiori irito 16 x 16 rcctanglcs. a i t h four sirnilar triangles in each. \vas siifficient for a good rcsult.) This being the fint study. instead of choosing rational spline interpolation. linear iritcrpolation Kas used. Tfic points where the stiffeners intersect werc choscri as the niaster

nodcs. Tlicx are 4 1 inaster nodcs for SPDI.4 witli SDF =1/? for a square platc discretizcd
into S x S scliiarcs. euch containing four sirnilar triangles. So. that becorrics S2 design variabIes (41 for t and t p eacli) plus orle more due to the stifFericr width b. which niakcs tlie total S3. The values of the variables at the niaster nodes w r e iised to ohtain the thickriess at earli of the finite elemrnt nodes throiigh linear interpolation.

Optimum Design
The optiniiini design was a flat plate with thickriess, t p = O.5mni. that is t p reached its loiver bounds. so did the wicltli b. The frequency constraint was active. The details are sliown in Table 5.3. But. the interesting fact is that the tliickness of the stiffencrs varies as shonn in Figure 5.1. Results sirnilar to these can also be found in

[q]. It

can be

obserwd that the mass of tlie stiffeners is concentrated arourid the central region. and thc corners. Xotice the fact the stiffener width has reached its lower bound, and that the average stiffener depth has increased from the initial design. This may be explained due to the fact the bending stiffness of a beam varies by the cube of the depth of the stiffener. Furthermore the mass of the stiffener lias decreased by 15.77% from the initial design, which makes the structure verp fragile. and may buckle at even lower loads. Hence, adding

a buckling constraint becornes a necessity.

Finite Eiement and Optimization Models
Because the buckling constraint was also being considered, half-plate mode1 was tised for analysis. The plate )vas cut into half along the asis in the which buckling load was applied, and appropriate symmetry boundary conditions were imposed.

If linear interpolation is used for design variable linking, the number of design variables would be roughlv double that compared to a quarter-plate model. This would take up a lot of time for the optiniizer to converge. Hence rational spline optimization (refer Section 4.2) j a s used. One rational spline surface was used for approsimating t p (the plate surface)! and one for t (the envelope surface of the stiffeners). The spline surfaces have a grid of 2 x 4 squares. The variables t 7and t p at the intersection of the grids were the design variables. That iso15 design variables each for t?and t p , plus the design variable 6, makes the total 31.

The optinlum results are shown in Table 5.5, and Figures 5.2 and 5.3. It m q be rioted that thc biickling constraint is active, meaning that it drives the design.

Methods to reduce the weight further
Two niethods were investigated.
First method: This may be named "Stiffener Pattern Splitting (SPS) llethod". This rriethod essentially consists of splitting a stiffener pattern into two or more groups based on the a t iffener orientation. and using different spline surfaces for representing different groups. For esample. in the case of SPDIA pattern, the stiffeners can be grouped into two. as the stifFeners are aligned at either of the t a o orientations. For a square plate mith SPDI.4, it can be -Go,and

+As0. So the group of stiffeners aligned a t

-45O,

have

one spline surface: and the rest tvill have another. The idea behind this approach is that the SPS method may help stiffeners of a certain orientation which are not necessary, to disappear, or reduce in thickness, and thus, reduce weight.

Secoiid method: Reduced SDF. For both the cases presented till now SDF was 119. So. the idea is to reduce it to 114. By doing this the stiffener pattern imposcd lias lesser nuinbcr of stiffeners. and thus the final mass may reduce. But. the problerri is. if the riumbcr of stiffeners are not sufficient to niake the plate stiff enough. the plate tliickiiess n i e incrrase. arid licnce incrcasc the m a s of the structure on the mhole. rather than decreasing it. Third method: Combination of both of the two mcthods discussed above. that is, rediiring SDF. and applyirig SPS niethod for interpolation. Tlic initial fcasiblc design for the three cases are shown in Table 5.6. Half plate riiodcls w r e uscd for al1 ttic cases. It should be noted that each spline surface liad 3 x 5 = 15 points. In cases 1 and 3. two spline surfaces for stiffeners. and one for the plate, were iised. Hencc. 45 design variables. .-\dditionally, oiie for the stiffener width b. wliich rnakes the total -16. Thr optimal designs are shown in Table 5.7, arid Figures 5.4 to 5.7. The spline surface for t p is shown onl'r for tlie case 3? as t p reached the lotver Gound of 0.5nirii in

d l the otlier cases. In Figures 5.4 and 5.6, DIAI refers to the negative aiiglcd diagonal stiffencrs. and DIA2 refers to the positive angled ones. The spline surfaces for DIA1 and

DIAZ. as niight be seen. are almost niirror images of eacli other (escept for the bunip in DIA2 of case 3). consistent with the stiffeners' orientations. Because the stiffcncr density is higher in case 1. the DIA1 and DIA2 stiffeners tend to zero near the right and left cdgcs. r.espccti\-ely The t spline surface of case 2 is quite similar to that of square plate with SPDI.4. and SDF = 112 in Figure 5.2.
-4s espected, the three cases show furtlier reductions, each being 1.9%, 26.7%. and

18.13% respectively, compared to the case of SPDIA (SDF = 1/2), and without SPS. The
best one turns out to be Square plate with SDF =

111 using

spline interpolation. and

without SPS method. What is interesting is that, case 3 gave a higher rnass than case 2. Probably. the design might have settled into one of the many local minima. Something that is common to al1 is that the buckling constraint was active. Furthermoreo the plate tended to vanish, and in the process the plate thickness reached its lower bound. The stiffener width was low in the majority of the cases.

Plates with Other Stiffener Patterns

.-\IItlie cases presented earlier weere for a plate a i t h SPDIA stiffeners. Here. tlie plates witli stiffencr patterns SPSQR. and SPDIASQ, will be presented. For al1 tlie cases considered.
a lialf-plate mode1 \vas used wi th appropriate symrnctry boiindary conditions. .As beforc

al1 thc plates were siniply supported. Iiiitial clesigns for the 6 cases cotisidered are shomn in Table 5.8. Sirnilar to thc prrvious cases. a 3 x 5 point spline surface \vas used in al1 the cases. For cases 1, 3 and
5 tlicre wcrt. two spline surfaces. one each for the stiffener assembly and plate. For case 2

tlicre w r e 3 spliric surfaces - one for the plate and two for the stiffencrs. In the cases 4 ancl 6. four splinr surfarrs w r e required for the stiffeners (as SPDIASQ lias stifferiers in four diff'wiit orientation). and one spline surface for the plate. Tlie rcsiilts of optiniization are presented in Table 5.9, and Figures 5.8 to 5.18. \l'hile rcfcrring to the plots where SPS niethod a s applied (Figures 5.9, 5.12, 5.13, a
5.16, and 5.17). it sliould be noted t h DIA1 and D U 2 refer to diagorial stiffcncrs of

-45' arid +-Ki0. respect ive15 arid. HOR and VER refer to horizontal and vertical stiffeners. respectively. In all tlie cases. csccpt 3. 5. and 6. the plate thickncss t p reaclicd its iower

boiinci of 0.5mm, arid hence. those are riot shown.

Thc casc of tlic plate with SPSQR ( SDF = 1/4 ) iras riot presetited. The rcason
k i n g that. in this pÃ¼rticular case the number of stifferiers was not enougli to get an initial fcasible desigii of low m a s , that is. the plate thickness had to be increased to ari estent of about 10riirn. and the mass a a s as high as 144kg. Given the number of desigii variables it. is reasonable enough to assume that the optimal design would settle in to a local minima having a higher mass than al1 the cases presented.

I t can be obserl-ed that, in general, the spline surfaces for the variable t for al1 the niethods not using SPS (cases 1, 3, and 5) look similar in shape, that is, the stiffeners close to middle of the edges tend to vanish. So, the trend is that the mass, in the form
of stiffeners, is being concentrated in aUbulge" encompassing the whole plate, witli some appendages around the corners. When SPS method was used, the spline surfaces representing stiffeners of different orientation took t here own shapes. Alt hough, spline surfaces of a particular stiffener angle took a similar shape in al1 cases.

The optimal masses obtained by the various cases presented are cornpared in Ta-

ble 5.10. It can seeii that the stiffener configuratioii of SPDIA (SDF = 114): rational spline interpolation arid particularly, without SPS method gives the best resiilt. The nest bcst configuration is SPSQR (SDF = 1/2). The stiffener pattern SPDIASQ gives the worst results witli both SDF = 112 arid 114, eitlier with or without SPS method applied. Froni cictors these resiilts one can conclude that while designing stiffened plates two important f. should br coiisiderrd: a) the stiffener pattern b) the stiffener density. The density: here. should not bc mistaken for tlie density of the material of the stiRener. I t is a measure of thc n ~ ~ r n b ofr stiffeners and their spacing. e

5.2

Rect angular St iffened Plat es

Because of the limitations in the cornputer resoiirces. only r~ctangular plates of ratios 2 1
and 3: 1 were corisidered. The breadth of the plate was 2000mm in both the cases. The four

stiffener configuratioiis. whidi gave the lowest masses for square plates were applied to the rectangular plates to denionstrate the present design met hodology. Half-plate models were uscd for anal?.sis. wit h the plate being halved along the length. Finite elernent analysis on the rectangular half-plate models of aforementioned ratios were carried out by discretizing into 8 x 32, and 8 x -LS squares, respectively, and each square being in turn divided into four identical triangles, by the diagonals. Doing this not only ensured that the size of the elements remained the same as those used for square plates, but also made it possible to get the stiffener orientations the same as those of the latter. (It is quite obvious that using rectangles instead of squares would make the orientation of the diagonal stiffeners not equal to i145"). The boundary condition was simply supported with symmetry conditions included. The initial designs can be found in Tables 5.11 and 5.13. The spline surfaces used for the 2 1 rectangle had 3 x 9 rnaster node points, while the 3:l rectangle had 3 x 13. Spline interpolation without SPS, as usual, required two spline surfaces, making the number of

design variables 54 and 75 respectively. for 2 1 and 3 l rectangles. It required 3 spline : surfaces for interpolation with SPS! giving 81 and 117 design variables. Adding one more design variable b. brings the totals to those shown the aforeineritioned tables. Thc results are shown in Tables 5.12 and 5.14, as well as in Figures 5.19 to 5.35. Soiiie of the observations made for square plate holds true for the rectangular plates. as wcll. The buckling constraint was active in ail the cases. The plate thickness tended to vanisli in al1 the cases. hence helping reduce the m a s . Whereas. the stiffener width for rcctaiigiilar plates remained higher than the lower bound unlike for the square plates where in niost of tlie cases it nttained. or remained close to. the l o w r bound. Tlic vibration modcs for al1 the 2:l plates studied were (1,l) modes. The buckling modcs for al1 tlic 2:l platc cases, escept case 4 in Table 5.12. were (2.1) modes. For case
4. it was (3.1). as shown in Figure 5.27. lnteresting associations car1 be made bctween

tlie splirit) siirfaces arid thc buciling modes for a given plate. For csample, compare the splinc plots (5.25 arid 5.26) with the buckling mode shape (Figure 5.27) for case 4. In

Figure 5.25(Ã¼). the curye at y = lOOOmm . ruiining parallel to the r - a i s . changes slope similar to tlie comparable central ciirve of the mode shape. The rriasirna of this curw is aroiind x = 1500112111 and 3500mm. similar to the mode shape. Siniilarly, the periodicity of t,he plate tliickness along the long edges in Figure 5.26 is in concurrence with the lengths of the half *'sine" surfaccs of the mode shape. This kind of an association between thc two should corrie as no surprise given the fact that, buckling constraint is active. The accordance with the mode sliapes and the splines is more subtle in other cases. In making such coniparisoiis it should be borne in rriind that the vibration mode. as irientioned. earlier is. (1.1). Both of these n i q influence the final shape aiid make the final shape of the splines look complicated.
The buckling mode was ( 3 J ) for al1 the 3:l plates escept case 3 in Table 5.14, which had (2.1) mode. The vibration modes were al1 (1,l).The mode sliape to spline surface association holds true for this too. stiffener configuration. Finally, similar to that for square plates, SPDIA (SDF = 11-1) in general. gave the lowest masses. although for 21 rectangular plates it was with SPS, and for 3:l plates it was without SPS. Thus! it can be concluded that SPDIA with SDF = 114 is the best stiffener configuration of al1 those studied.

Concluding Remarks on the Results

I l togctlier 3 s t iffeiier patterns were considered: SPDI-4. SPSQR. and SPDIASQ. For each
of these. Stiffener Density Factors (SDFs) of 112 and 1/1 were considered. Rational spline interpolation was used for linking the design variables. A Stiffener Pattern Splitting (SPS) nietliod of interpolation was introdiiced and applied on al1 the stiffener configurations. It
ivas foiind tliat SPDIA n i t h SDF = 114 with (in most cases) or without (in one case) SPS

method gave the lowest mass. Most importantly it can be concluded that the proposed
opt inial tlcsign rnct hodology gives good results.

Summary and Conclusions
This work presented a methodology for the optimal design of stiffened plates having frequericy and buckling constraints. The basic idea was to assumc that a plate had a fairly dense distribution of stiffeners in a specific pattern. The analysis of the stiffcned plate \vas carried out by finite element analysis, with the plate being modeled by IIiridlin plate elenients. and the stifferiers by Timoshenko beam elernents. A11 the necessary finite elenient derivations wcre erilisted. The elements were validated by comparing with analytical solutions. The three stiffener patterns (SPDI-A, SPSQR, and SPDI-ASQ) considered, and a quantity associated witli niimber of stiffeners and their spacings, called Stiffener Density Factor (SDF) Kas described. A combination of one of the stiffener patterns with an SDF
gave a specific stiffener configuration.

The optimization mode1 made use of spline surfaces for linking the design variables, tlius reducing the niimber of design variables significantly. Stiffener Pattern Splitting (SPS) method was introduced as a way of reducing the mass further. Results aere presented for a square plate with many stiffener configurations. The four best configurations which gave the lowest mass were applied to rectangular plates for ratios 2:l and 3:l. In general, it was found that SPDIA (SDF = 114) gave the best results. Alsol the foilowing observations were made: The deep stiffeners having smalI width were dominant. The plate thickness in al1 the cases tended to vanish, and thus attained the Iower bound.

There appeared to be a delicate balance between the stiffener density and the plate thickn~ss.If the the density of the stiffeners \vas not sufficient to give enough stiffness, then the plate thickness increased, increasing the m a s of the structure.
i

'The buckling constraint \vas active for al1 the cases considered, aiid hence drow the design. Interrsting associations between the buckling mode shapes and the optimal spline surfaces werc observcd for rectangular plates. Fiiially, it \vas coricludcd that the present methodology gives good results. and illiis-

tratcs tliat stiffenpr pattern and deiisity play a n important role in the design of stiffened plates.

Recommendations for Future Work

The riiajor cori~traints considcred iri this work were only the frequency and biickling constraiiits. biit i t would be evcn more rcalistic to consider some more like the stress constraints. The stiffcner patterns analyzed were of standard angles O". &-la0. a n d 90". Hetice. there is a scopc to consider stiffeners of other angles. and differcnt patterns. The patterns
were assunied to be static in this work. It would be interesting to take a few stiffeners,

and allow them to niove? while optimizing. Another direction in which this work can be estended, is to make use of composite niaterials. The density of the fibers could be the design variables.
