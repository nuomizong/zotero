We present in this paper MITC shell elements for large strain solutions of shell structures. While we focus on the 4-node element, the same formulation is also applicable to the 3-node element. Since the elements are formulated using three-dimensional continuum theory with the full three-dimensional constitutive behavior, they are referred to as 3D-shell elements. Speciﬁc contributions in this paper are that the elements are formulated using two control vectors at each node to describe the large deformations, MITC tying and volume preserving conditions acting directly on the material ﬁber vectors to avoid shear locking, and a pressure interpolation to circumvent volumetric locking. Also, we present solutions to some large strain shell problems that represent valuable benchmark tests for any large strain shell analysis capability. Ó 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction The analysis of shells undergoing large strains has attracted a considerable research effort, see Refs. [1–19] and the references therein. There are many practical situations where structures modeled as shells undergo large strains, like in metal forming and the crush and crash simulations of motorcars. Special ﬁnite element programs have been developed to solve such problems. However, although much research has been focused on the large strain analysis of shells and various computer programs are already abundantly used to simulate shell structures in large deformations and strains, there is still need for more reliable and efﬁcient elements. Indeed, the ﬁeld of shell analysis – in general – is so rich that research in many areas is still needed, see Refs. [20–22]. To model the large strain behavior of shells, different approaches can be pursued. The simplest approach is to perform a large deformation analysis and update the thickness of the shell elements iteratively during the incremental solution [5]. This approach requires relatively small incremental steps and is only attractive when the strains through the shell thickness are not very large. The second approach is to model the shell using three-dimensional (3D) solid elements, and here typically 12-node or 27-node displacement-based elements are used to model the shell with a single element layer to allow straining through the shell thickness. These models suffer from shear and membrane locking, and to a lesser degree from pinching locking [21]; hence very ﬁne meshes

may need to be used and as a consequence, general large strain shell problems in practice can be expensive to solve [23,24]. The third approach is to use three-dimensional continuum theory to develop 3D-shell elements. These elements contain the kinematics of the three-dimensional solid elements used in the second approach, referred to above, but the geometry and displacement behavior are described with variables on the shell midsurface only. For example, the 12-node solid element reduces to a 4-node shell element and the 27-node solid element reduces to a 9-node shell element, each with degrees of freedom at the shell element nodes that are used in addition to those usually employed for shell elements. A mathematical analysis of the underlying displacementbased 3D-shell mathematical model for linear analysis is given in Refs. [21,25,26]. However, like the displacement-based 3D solid elements, the displacement-based 3D-shell elements used in the discretization of this mathematical model are hardly usable because of locking phenomena, and to obtain an effective 3D-shell element it is necessary to circumvent these detrimental effects [21]. A number of researchers used the enhanced assumed strain (EAS) approach to propose 3D-shell elements, see e.g. Refs. [2,3,27]. Considering this approach, one disadvantage is that the use of ‘enhanced strains’ render an element computationally quite inefﬁcient, due to the additional strain terms, but another disadvantage is that such elements exhibit severe instabilities at large strains, see Refs. [28,29]. Many researchers used ‘reduced integration’ which also results into instabilities, that is, spurious zero energy modes [30]. These instabilities – encountered with the EAS approach and the reduced integration schemes – can be suppressed using artiﬁcial numerical factors that at large strains may need to change with

the deformation response [31–34]. While the reduced integration techniques have been used abundantly in explicit dynamic analyses, difﬁculties are encountered in static and slow dynamic situations. In fact, the use of any of these numerical factors is quite undesirable, in particular, when large deformations and large strains shall be predicted, since the solutions may contain physical instabilities that may be masked by artiﬁcial factors; hence the solutions can be unreliable and quite inaccurate. A requirement that we focus on in our developments, is to not have element instabilities in the formulation and not use any artiﬁcial numerical factors. Spurious zero energy modes should not exist, and this must hold for any amount of reasonable deformations and straining. Hence we do not use the methods of enhanced assumed strains and reduced integration. Instead, we employ, in general, the MITC approach to avoid shear and membrane locking in plate and shell solutions [21,30], and the displacement/pressure (u/p) formulation to circumvent volumetric locking in solids [30]. In the next sections, we give the formulation of the 3D-shell elements that we deem to be effective. These elements build upon the usual triangular and quadrilateral MITC shell elements [35,36] and are developed to model large strain behavior. In a section thereafter we present various example solutions that can be regarded to be benchmark tests for large strain shell formulations. While we focus in the paper on a 4-node element (which is mostly used), the discussion is also directly applicable to a 3-node element, however, as pointed out in Section 2.5, the relevant strain interpolations need to be used [36]. Both the 4-node and 3-node elements have been implemented in the ADINA ﬁnite element program. 2. Formulation of the 3D-shell element In this section we give the fundamental concepts used in the formulation of the 3D-shell elements and the notation. We consider general nonlinear analysis, with large displacements and large strains. For the most part, the notation is the same as in Ref. [30]. 2.1. Kinematics The kinematic description of the 3D-shell element, in a Cartesian coordinate system, is based on the quantities shown in Fig. 1. The element in the ﬁgure, with four midsurface nodes

L = 1, . . . , 4, is described by the positions of the nodes given at time t by the vectors txmL, with components t xmL ; i ¼ 1; 2; 3, and the i nodal control vectors taL and tbL, with components t aL and i t L bi ; i ¼ 1; 2; 3. An isoparametric coordinate system is used, in which r1, r2 are the isoparametric coordinates on the midsurface and r3 is the isoparametric coordinate out of the midsurface. At a given point (r1, r2, r3), the position of a material particle at time t is given by

where xmi, i = 1, 2, 3, gives the position of a material particle on the midsurface, the tai and tbi, i = 1, 2, 3, are the components of the control vectors ta and tb at the point (r1,r2), the hL are the shape functions deﬁned on the midsurface and the summation is over all nodes L. In the following presentation we shall always imply that the subscript i is for the values 1, 2, 3 and no longer explicitly state so. There are two differences between the control vectors ta, tb and the usual director vector tVn with components tVni [30]. The control vectors include the element thickness, whereas a director vector is of unit length, and there are two control vectors at each point on the midsurface, whereas there is only one director vector at such point. Note that the kinematic assumptions used here are more general than for the element presented in Ref. [37], which was developed for large displacement solutions but small strains. The initial (time = 0.0) control vectors at each node are equal and opposite, with

where aL ; 0 V L are the initial thickness and the components of the ni director vector at node L. Hence the initial control vectors 0a, 0b are equal and opposite everywhere on the element midsurface. Consider a line of material particles at a position r1, r2 that extends from r3 = À1 to r3 = 1. This line is denoted as ‘‘the line through the thickness’’. Along this line,

Evidently the line through the thickness is straight when ta and tb are parallel (opposite but not necessarily of equal lengths), and is curved otherwise. The stretch along this line is

which shows that the stretch along this line, and hence the strain along this line, depends on r3. For the case when ta, tb are parallel, namely when tai = ktaktVni, tbi = ÀktbktVni, Eq. (5) becomes
1 t 0k

¼2

ð6Þ

which shows that the stretch along this line depends in general linearly on r3. It is necessary to allow the strain along the line through the thickness to depend on r3. For example, in pure out-of-plane bending, with the material for r3 > 0 in tension and for r3 < 0 in compression, the Poisson effect causes the element to thin for r3 > 0 and to thicken for r3 < 0. 2.2. Nodal degrees of freedom Each node has, at most, the following nodal degrees of freedom:

Du i Dhi De e D~ h D~i

incremental translations of the node, with components in the global system, incremental rotations at the node, with components in the global system, constant thickness incremental strain, linear thickness incremental strain, incremental warping rotations at the node, with components in the global system,

thickness incremental strain’’ is appropriate for De. Also, a positive value for D~ lengthens ta and shortens tb, so the name ‘‘linear e thickness incremental strain’’ is appropriate for D~. e We also note that the degrees of freedom Dhi control the rotations of ta and tb equally, so these degrees of freedom can be said to be the ‘‘rotations’’ at the node. On the other hand, the degrees of freedom D~i cause equal and opposite rotations of ta and tb. Since h 0 a and 0b are initially equal and opposite, if D~i is zero throughout h the analysis, then the vectors ta and tb remain opposite (but not necessarily equal in length), and therefore all of the lines through the thickness remain straight. Hence the effect of D~i is to warp h the lines through the thickness from straight lines into curved lines, and the name ‘‘warping rotations’’ is used for D~i . h In thin shells, it is frequently assumed that the lines through the thickness remain straight. This condition is easily modeled by deleting the warping rotation degrees of freedom. Then the nodal degrees of freedom are Dui ; Dhi ; De; D~. e The choice of rotations Dhi ; D~i , with components given in the h global coordinate system, has the drawback that an incremental rotation about ta causes no update of ta (and similar for an incremental rotation about tb). Hence there are two zero energy rotations per node. To avoid this situation, in each case, new directions of rotations with one component parallel to the control vector are chosen, and the degree of freedom for the parallel component is deleted. We do not give the details here, as the process is similar to that given in Ref. [30]. 2.3.

2.5. Tying rule So far we presented the kinematics of a 3D-shell element based on displacement assumptions only. The kinematical description used represents an extension of the usual displacement-based shell description [30]. While the asymptotic behaviors of the mathematical shell models using director vectors are understood [21,25,38], it is well-known that the displacement-based models are not effective due to locking phenomena. For the low-order elements that we consider here, the shear locking effects need to be relieved and we describe next how we proceed. We focus in this section on the MITC4 3D-shell element but the presentation is also directly applicable to the 3-node element with the appropriate strain interpolations [36]. The tying rule to relieve shear locking in large strain analysis is an extension and reinterpretation of the tying rule used in the classical shell element [30,35]. In the following, the superscript DI denotes a quantity obtained directly from the displacement interpolation and the superscript AS denotes an ‘‘assumed strain’’, namely a quantity obtained including the effects of tying. In the MITC4 classical shell element, the components t eAS are computed from the t eDI using r ij r ij

Section 3 gives a simple physical interpretation of this tying rule.  t AS  0 AS Once the components @ xi and @ xi for i = 1, 2, 3 are @r 3 @r 3 known, we can compute all quantities. For example, Eq. (13b) be  comes t eAS ¼ 1 t CAS À 0 CAS . Thus, through the remainder of our r r 2 r presentation, we drop the superscript AS. Note that all the above discussion is directly applicable to the 3node 3D-shell element in which also only the transverse shear strain components (that is, the corresponding Cauchy–Green deformation tensor components) are interpolated and tied. 2.6. Material law In the formulation of classical small strain shell elements, it is assumed that the stress in the direction normal to the midsurface is zero. This assumption allows the strain in this direction, for any material behavior, to be condensed out of the material relationship. Hence there are, for example, no difﬁculties with incompressible material behaviors. However, in the 3D-shell element, the assumption of zero stress through the shell thickness is not used in the material law. All strain components / deformation gradient components enter the material law, exactly as in the material law for 3D solid elements. We consider materials undergoing large strains. For hyperelastic materials, we can directly write
t 0 Sij

with t C AS ¼ t C DI for the other components. Notice that the same tyr ij r ij ing rule is used for the conﬁguration at time 0 and the conﬁguration at time t. In the following, we focus on the conﬁguration at time t, with the understanding that we use the same tying rule for the conﬁgurations at all times considered. Now the Cauchy–Green deformation tensor, referred to the isoparametric system, is constructed as the dot product of vectors using Eq. (13a), for example

Thus tying conditions expressed as conditions on the t C ij can also be r expressed as tying conditions on the material ﬁber vectors @ x. Since @ri only t C 13 , t C 23 are affected by the tying, it is natural to keep the vecr r tors @r1 ; @r2 unchanged during the tying process (so that the components vector

Principle of virtual work for incompressible analysis In practice, many materials undergoing large strains exhibit almost incompressible behavior, for example, rubber-like materials and elastic–plastic materials. Hence a practical large strain shell element must be usable with incompressible materials. For such analyses, the MITC4 3D-shell element should be used with the pressure interpolation discussed below to avoid volumetric locking. In the following, we assume that the relationship between the pressure and volume ratio can be written as tp = f(t J 3 ), where, for 0 ease of writing, we deﬁne t J 3 = det t X. We will also use the inverse 0 0 relationship t J 3 = fÀ1(tp). 0 We use a form of the u/p mixed formulation [30] for the internal virtual work

undergoing membrane action only, the tp1 degrees of freedom will be zero and the elements will all have constant pressure, similar to an assemblage of three-dimensional 8/1 elements (8 nodes for displacements and constant element pressure). These 8-node brick elements can checker-board in pressure when uniform meshes and

speciﬁc boundary conditions are used [30] but checker-boarding is hardly observed in practice. Note that the 3-node 3D-shell element with the above pressure interpolation is not effective in incompressible analysis, since in pure membrane situations the element would lock as does the constant strain triangular element in plane strain conditions. 3.

related to the tying of strain components in the MITC4 classical

shell element, without changing the determinant of the deformation gradient. The tying rule has a simple physical interpretation. Consider ﬁrst that Eq. (1) can be interpreted as giving the positions of laminae parallel to the shell midsurface (see Fig. 2). Namely, for each coordinate r3, there is a differentially thick lamina (the thickness is given by dr3). Fig. 3 shows a simple schematic example in two dimensions, in which the element is drawn from the side, so that the element thickness is in the y direction. Initially the sides of the element are straight (Fig. 3a) and the three differential elements A, B, C along the shown lamina are square. When the shell element is subjected to out-of-plane shear (Fig. 3b), each of the differential elements A, B, C shear by the same amount. Thus Eq. (16) gives

When the shell element is subjected to pure out-of-plane bending (Fig. 3c), the differential elements A, B, C stretch the same @t amounts in the x direction (in other words the material ﬁber @rx in1 creases in length, and this increase is the same for each differential element). However the differential elements also shear, and this shear varies along the lamina. This example illustrates the cause of shear locking, namely, when the shell element attempts to represent a state of pure bending, spurious shear is produced in the laminae. In this case Eq. (16) gives t C AS ¼ 0; 0 C AS ¼ 0; t C AS ¼ 0; 0 C AS ¼ 0. r 13 r 13 r 23 r 23  AS @t is perpendicular to The ﬁrst two rows of Eq. (22) show that @rx 3
@t x @r1 @ and @rx, and the last row of Eq. (22) shows that the volume of the 2
t

are now uniform within the lamina, each differential element has stretched, in accordance with the stretching of the lamina, and the undesirable shear has been removed. In addition, the differential volume used in the stress–strain calculations is the same as the differential volume obtained from the kinematical assumptions. This is very important in incompressible analysis, since a motion that is volume preserving remains volume preserving after the tying is applied. Fig. 4 summarizes schematically the change in the material ﬁber due to tying. Note that the tying process violates displacement compatibility between adjacent laminae, as shown in Fig. 5. Hence the tying can be interpreted as a weakening of the strain–displacement compatibility conditions (as can the MITC tying of strain components in the classical shell element).

differential elements does not change as a result of the tying. The result is shown in Fig. 3d. Notice that the differential elements

4. Illustrative solutions This section gives some illustrative benchmark problems and solutions. The geometries of the problems given here are relatively simple, and are fully described. The problems are solved not

addressing the questions of efﬁciency, the order of numerical integration through the thickness, how coarse a (possibly graded) mesh could be used, and the effects of mesh reﬁnements through the thickness (for the 3D solid element meshes used for comparison). These questions we leave for further studies. The problems are solved using the MITC4 3D-shell element which is clearly more effective than the triangular element [22]. As all of the solutions involve incompressible material behavior, the u/p formulation is used throughout. Additional problem solutions in which the MITC4 3D-shell element is used are given, for example, in Ref. [39]. 4.1. Plane strain bending, neo-Hookean material model Here we consider the solution of the problem given in Fig. 6. The analytical solution to this problem can be obtained with the method given in Ref. [40]. The problem can be solved using a mesh of 50 4-node 3D-shell elements, using 3-point Gauss integration through the thickness. Fig. 7 shows the deformed meshes at four solution times. The thinning in tension and the thickening in compression are clearly observed. Fig. 8 shows the moment–curvature response for ﬁnite element meshes with various numbers of 4-node 3D-shell elements, along with the analytical solution. The ﬁnite element solution is too stiff in general, however the solution improves as the mesh is reﬁned.

4.2. Plane strain folding of a thin shell, elastic–plastic material model One way to generate high curvatures in thin shells is to form a fold. Fig. 9 shows the problem considered. The shell is thin (thickness/length = 1/500) and an elastic-perfectly plastic material model is used. As the moving contact surface displaces downwards, the shell is squeezed and a fold forms where the shell is ﬁxed. For the solution, we use meshes of 4-node 3D-shell elements, and also, for comparison, meshes of the 27/4 three-dimensional (3D) solid elements (for which the u/p formulation with 27 nodes for the displacements and 4 pressure degrees of freedom per element is used [30]). The meshes are graded so that the elements are smallest at the built-in end. In all of the analyses, 3-point Gauss integration is used through the shell thickness. For the 100 element mesh of 3D-shell elements, Fig. 10 shows a detail of the undeformed model near the built-in end, and Figs. 11 and 12 show the deformed mesh for the prescribed displacements discussed below. Fig. 13 shows the calculated force–deﬂection curves. On both axes, a log scale is used so that the entire solution response over the whole range of displacements can be shown in one ﬁgure. The calculated responses are quite close to each other, however, as expected, the 50 element 3D solid element model is stiffer than the other models. For displacements above 49.5 mm, the force–deﬂection curves exhibit a ‘‘stair-step’’ behavior. This behavior arises due to the contact algorithm; the force–deﬂection curve stiffens each time an additional node comes into contact. We note the following regarding the solution response at various displacements: Displacement of 7.8 mm: The built-in end begins to become plastic. The force–deﬂection curve softens at this point. This softening happens ‘‘suddenly’’ because only three integration points

are used through the thickness, so most of the section becomes immediately plastic. Displacement of 38.4 mm: The free end of the mesh becomes horizontal and the contact forces on the free end of the mesh start to become distributed over the free end. The plastic strain is only about 4.5% at the built-in end. The force–deﬂection curve begins to stiffen because the moment arm of the forces acting on the shell model begins to decrease. Displacement of 49.34 mm: The free end of the mesh contacts the bottom contact surface. Displacement of 49.9 mm: Fig. 12 shows a detail of the 100 element model of 3D-shell elements at the displacement of 49.9 mm, and also contours of the accumulated effective plastic strain. The plastic strain at the built-in end is almost 67%. 4.3. Buckling of a thin geometrically perturbed cylindrical shell, elastic–plastic material model Another way to generate high curvatures in thin shells is to create a plastic hinge by buckling. Fig. 14 shows the problem considered. The shell segment is thin (thickness/length = 1/100) and an elastic-perfectly plastic material model is used. The geometry of the midsurface of the perturbed cylindrical shell segment is given in terms of parametric coordinates n1, n2 as follows:

x ¼ n1 ;
where

y ¼ ðR À bÞ cos h þ b cosðh þ aÞ;

z ¼ ðR À bÞ sin h þ b sinðh þ aÞ

b¼B

n 1 þ cos pL 1 ; 2

h ¼ p=2 À n2 =R;

a ¼ maxð0; 4ðh À p=4ÞÞ

and 0 6 n1 6 L; 0 6 n2 6 p R. Here R, L are the radius and length of 2 the shell segment, and B is the perturbation. With B = 0, the above

directly on the material ﬁber vectors to avoid shear locking and preserve the volume. Since material incompressibility may be encountered in large strains, we also use the u/p formulation when this condition need be modeled. To obtain insight into the capabilities of the element, we presented the solutions of benchmark problems. These solutions should also be valuable to test other shell element formulations for their applicability in large strain analyses. However, as previously mentioned, further studies of these benchmark problems regarding efﬁciency, numerical integration, mesh grading, and mesh reﬁnements through the thickness (when using 3D solid element meshes) would be valuable.

formulas reduce to the geometry of a cylindrical segment with length L and radius R, and with boundaries x = 0, x = L, y = 0, z = 0. The shell geometric perturbation at a constant x coordinate is shown in Fig. 14c. It is seen that the cross-section (thick line) is constructed using two circles, one circle with radius R À b and the other circle with radius b. The slope of the cross-section line is zero at y = 0. The shell cross-section for y = 0 is shown in Fig. 14d. Here, it is seen that the slope of the cross-section line is zero at x = 0. For the ﬁnite element solutions, we use 3D-shell elements and also 3D solid elements (the 27/4 solid element) for comparison. In all cases, 3-point Gauss integration is used through the thickness. Fig. 15 shows the calculated deformed geometries of a 50 Â 75 3D-shell element mesh for compressive prescribed displacements of 1, 2, 3, 4 mm. Fig. 16 shows the same mesh for a prescribed displacement of 4 mm. A fold forms near the x = 0 line of symmetry and very large strains are generated at the fold. Fig. 17 shows the force–deﬂection curves obtained using 3Dshell and 3D solid element meshes of various mesh reﬁnements. The calculated force–displacement responses are very close to each other. In addition, the location and shape of the fold is similar for all of the meshes.

5. Concluding remarks The objective in this paper was to present a large strain shell element formulation and benchmark solutions. The element formulation represents an extension of the now widely used MITC4 shell element. While we focused on the 4-node element, the same approach can directly be employed to also establish the 3-node MITC 3D-shell element, of course using the relevant strain tying interpolations. Considering higher-order MITC 3D-shell elements, the discussion given in the paper is also applicable, but since the membrane and hence bending strains are also tied, see Ref. [30], additional considerations arise. Also, while higher-order plate and shell elements can be effective in linear analyses [21,22,41,42], it is still questionable how effective such elements are in large strain solutions (involving frequently also contact conditions). Some special considerations are needed to obtain a formulation that can reliably be used for the analysis of shells in very large strains. Speciﬁcally, we use two control vectors to describe the kinematics of the shell behavior, and tying conditions acting
